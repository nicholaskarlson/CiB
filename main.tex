\subsection{Solutions to Exercises on Domain and Range}

\begin{solution}[1]
For \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \), the domain is all real numbers since there are no restrictions on \( x \). The range is also all real numbers because as \( x \) takes any real value, \( 2x + 3 \) also covers all real numbers.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[2]
The function \( g(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2} \) is undefined when \( x = 2 \), so the domain is \( x \neq 2 \). The range is all real numbers except \( y \neq 0 \) because the function never touches the y-axis.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
For the quadratic function \( h(x) = x^2 - 6x + 9 \), the domain is all real numbers. Since the vertex of this parabola is at \( x = 3 \) and it opens upwards, the minimum value is \( h(3) = 0 \), thus the range is \( y \geq 0 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[4]

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[5]
For \( m(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 4} \), the function is undefined for \( x = \pm 2 \), so the domain is \( x \neq \pm 2 \). The range is all real numbers, as the function can take any y-value.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[6]
The domain of the trigonometric function \( n(x) = \sin(x) \) is all real numbers. The range of the sine function is between -1 and 1, inclusive, so \( y \in [-1, 1] \).
\end{solution}

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[8]
The piecewise function \( q(x) \) is defined for all real numbers, so the domain is all real numbers. To find the range, consider each piece: \( x^2 \) and \( 2x + 3 \). The range is all non-negative values for \( x^2 \) and all real numbers for \( 2x + 3 \), thus the range is all real numbers.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[9]
For the exponential function \( r(x) = 2^x \), the domain is all real numbers, as exponents can take any real value. The range is \( y > 0 \) since exponential functions are always positive.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[10]
The cubic function \( s(x) = x^3 - 3x \) has a domain of all real numbers. The range is also all real numbers because as a cubic function, it extends infinitely in both the positive and negative y-directions.
\end{solution}


\section{Types of Functions}
\subsection{Linear Functions}
\begin{definition}
A linear function has the form \( f(x) = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope of the line and \( b \) is the y-intercept.
\end{definition}

Linear functions are fundamental in calculus and represent the simplest form of polynomial functions. Their graph is a straight line, and they have constant rates of change.

\paragraph{Properties of Linear Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The slope \( m \) determines the steepness of the line and its direction (increasing or decreasing).
    \item The y-intercept \( b \) is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
    \item Linear functions have a constant rate of change, which is equal to the slope \( m \).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing a Linear Function:}
Consider the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \). Here, \( m = 2 \) and \( b = 3 \). The graph can be plotted as follows:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = left,
    xlabel = \( x \),
    ylabel = {\( f(x) \)},
    xmin=-10, xmax=10,
    ymin=-10, ymax=10,
    grid=both,
    grid style={line width=.1pt, draw=gray!10},
    major grid style={line width=.2pt,draw=gray!50},
    minor tick num=1,
    enlargelimits={abs=0.5},
    axis line style={latex-latex},
    ticklabel style={font=\small,fill=white},
    xlabel style={at={(ticklabel* cs:1)},anchor=north west},
    ylabel style={at={(ticklabel* cs:1)},anchor=south west}
]
% Plotting the line
\addplot[domain=-10:10, samples=100, color=blue]{2*x + 3};
\node[anchor=west] at (axis cs: 5,13) {\(f(x) = 2x + 3\)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

This line intersects the y-axis at (0, 3) and has a slope of 2, indicating it rises 2 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right.

\paragraph{Slope-Intercept Form:}
The equation \( f(x) = mx + b \) is known as the slope-intercept form of a linear function, where the slope \( m \) and y-intercept \( b \) are easily identifiable.

\paragraph{Applications of Linear Functions:}
Linear functions model relationships with a constant rate of change and are widely used in various fields such as economics, physics, and social sciences.

\end{exercise}

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Exercises on Linear Functions}

\begin{solution}[1]
For \( g(x) = -3x + 7 \), the slope (m) is -3, and the y-intercept (b) is 7. The graph is a straight line with a downward slope, crossing the y-axis at (0, 7).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[2]
To find the equation of a line passing through (1, 2) and (3, 6), calculate the slope \( m = \frac{6 - 2}{3 - 1} = 2 \). Using the point-slope form: \( y - 2 = 2(x - 1) \), the equation is \( y = 2x \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
A line parallel to \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) has the same slope, m = 4. Passing through (2, 3), use point-slope form: \( y - 3 = 4(x - 2) \), yielding \( y = 4x - 5 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[4]
To find the intersection of \( f(x) = 2x + 1 \) and \( g(x) = -x + 5 \), set them equal: \( 2x + 1 = -x + 5 \). Solving gives \( x = \frac{4}{3} \), and substituting back, \( y = \frac{11}{3} \). Thus, they intersect at \( (\frac{4}{3}, \frac{11}{3}) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[5]

\end{solution}

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[8]

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[9]
The slope is \( \frac{4 - (-2)}{3 - (-1)} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2} \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[10]
Let \( P = mn + b \). Using given points, form equations: \( 4000 = 500m + b \) and \( -2000 = 200m + b \). Solving these simultaneously gives \( m = 20 \) and \( b = -6000 \). So, \( P = 20n - 6000 \).
\end{solution}


\subsection{Polynomial Functions}
\begin{definition}
A polynomial function is of the form \( f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer, and \( a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0 \) are constants.
\end{definition}

Polynomial functions are fundamental in calculus and algebra. They can range from simple linear functions to complex equations with high degrees. The highest power of \( x \) in the function (the degree of the polynomial) greatly influences the shape and behavior of its graph.

\paragraph{Characteristics of Polynomial Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The degree of the polynomial determines its basic shape and the number of roots.
    \item Polynomials are continuous and smooth functions.
    \item The leading coefficient \( a_n \) affects the end behavior of the polynomial.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing Polynomial Functions:}
Consider the quadratic function \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \). Its graph can be plotted as follows:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines=middle,
    xlabel=\(x\),

\node[anchor=west] at (axis cs: 4,3) {\(f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3\)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

This graph represents a parabola opening upwards with its vertex and intercepts easily identifiable.

\end{solution}


\subsection{Rational Functions}
\begin{definition}
A rational function is the ratio of two polynomial functions, typically expressed in the form \( f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} \), where both \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \) are polynomial functions and \( q(x) \neq 0 \).
\end{definition}

Rational functions can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including asymptotes and discontinuities, making them interesting subjects of study in calculus.

\paragraph{Characteristics of Rational Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The vertical asymptotes occur at values of \( x \) for which \( q(x) = 0 \), provided these points are not cancelled out by the numerator.
    \item Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of \( p(x) \) and \( q(x) \).
    \item Rational functions may have holes if a factor in the denominator is cancelled out by the numerator.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing Rational Functions:}
Consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} \). Here, we have a hole at \( x = 2 \) because the factor \( (x - 2) \) is cancelled. The graph can be plotted as follows:

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = \( x \),
    ylabel = {\( f(x) \)},

Trigonometric functions include \( \sin(x) \), \( \cos(x) \), and \( \tan(x) \), relating angles to ratios of sides in right triangles.
\end{definition}

Trigonometric functions are fundamental in calculus, physics, and engineering. They are periodic functions and have various properties that are essential in the study of waves, oscillations, and circular motion.

\paragraph{Properties of Trigonometric Functions:}

\subsection{Exponential and Logarithmic Functions}
\begin{definition}
Exponential functions have the form \( f(x) = a^x \) where \( a \) is a positive constant. Logarithmic functions are the inverses of exponential functions and are usually expressed as \( g(x) = \log_a(x) \) for a logarithm to the base \( a \).
\end{definition}

Exponential and logarithmic functions are widely used in many fields, including physics, engineering, and economics, due to their properties of describing growth and decay processes.

\paragraph{Characteristics of Exponential Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exponential growth occurs when \( a > 1 \), and exponential decay happens when \( 0 < a < 1 \).
    \item The graph of an exponential function always lies above the x-axis and increases or decreases rapidly.
    \item Exponential functions have a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Characteristics of Logarithmic Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The logarithmic function \( \log_a(x) \) is undefined for \( x \leq 0 \).
    \item The graph of a logarithmic function passes through the point \( (1, 0) \) and has a vertical asymptote at \( x = 0 \).
    \item Logarithmic functions increase slowly and are used to model the inverse of exponential growth or decay.
\end{itemize}

\end{solution}


\section{Function Properties}
\subsection{Continuity}
\begin{definition}
A function is continuous at a point if the limit of the function as it approaches the point is equal to the function value at that point. Formally, a function \( f(x) \) is continuous at a point \( c \) if \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c) \).
\end{definition}

Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus, essential for understanding limits, derivatives, and integrals.

\paragraph{Types of Discontinuities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A function has a \textit{removable discontinuity} at a point if the limit exists but is not equal to the function value at that point.
    \item A \textit{jump discontinuity} occurs when the left-hand and right-hand limits exist but are not equal to each other.
    \item An \textit{infinite discontinuity} occurs when the function approaches infinity near the point of discontinuity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing Continuous Functions:}
To illustrate continuity, consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} \) and its simplified form \( g(x) = x + 2 \). The function \( f(x) \) has a removable discontinuity at \( x = 2 \).

For \( h(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \), factorize the numerator to get \( h(x) = \frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} \). At \( x = 1 \), the function simplifies to \( h(1) = 2 \), and the limit as \( x \) approaches 1 is also 2. Hence, \( h(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 1 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[2]
For \( k(x) \), at \( x < 2 \), \( k(x) = x^2 \); at \( x = 2 \), \( k(x) = 4 \); and at \( x > 2 \), \( k(x) = x + 2 \). The left-hand limit as \( x \) approaches 2 is 4, and the right-hand limit is also 4. Since the function value at \( x = 2 \) is 4, \( k(x) \) is continuous at \( x = 2 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) is not continuous at \( x = 0 \) because it is not defined there (the denominator becomes zero), and the limits as \( x \) approaches 0 are \( \pm \infty \).
\end{solution}

\end{solution}

\subsection{Differentiability}
\begin{definition}
A function is differentiable at a point if it has a defined derivative at that point. Formally, a function \( f(x) \) is differentiable at \( c \) if the limit \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h}\) exists.
\end{definition}

Differentiability is a key concept in calculus, relating closely to the continuity of a function and its smoothness.

\paragraph{Characteristics of Differentiable Functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If a function is differentiable at a point, it is also continuous at that point, but the converse is not necessarily true.
    \item A function may fail to be differentiable at a point if it has a corner, cusp, or vertical tangent, or is discontinuous at that point.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing and Analyzing Differentiability:}
Consider a function \( f(x) \) with a cusp at \( x = 0 \). For example, \( f(x) = |x| \) is not differentiable at \( x = 0 \) due to the cusp.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines=middle,

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Exercises on Differentiability}

\begin{solution}[1]
The function \( g(x) = x^2 \) is differentiable at \( x = 0 \). This is because its derivative \( g'(x) = 2x \) is defined at \( x = 0 \) (with \( g'(0) = 0 \)), showing that the function is smooth and has no sharp corners or cusps at this point.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[2]
The piecewise function \( h(x) \) is differentiable at \( x = 1 \) as both pieces of the function have the same derivative at this point. For \( x \leq 1 \), the derivative is \( 2x \), and for \( x > 1 \), it is 2. Since both derivatives equal 2 at \( x = 1 \), the function is differentiable there.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
The function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) is not differentiable at \( x = 0 \) because it is not defined at this point. The function has a discontinuity (infinite discontinuity) at \( x = 0 \), which precludes differentiability.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[4]
The function \( k(x) = |x| \) is not differentiable at \( x = 0 \). Although the function is continuous at \( x = 0 \), it has a sharp corner at this point, which means that the limit defining the derivative does not exist.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[5]
For \( p(x) = x^3 \), the derivative is \( p'(x) = 3x^2 \). At \( x = 2 \), \( p'(2) = 12 \). The function is differentiable at this point as the derivative is defined and finite.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[6]

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[7]

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[10]
The function \( u(x) = e^x \) is differentiable for all real numbers \( x \) because its derivative, \( e^x \), is defined and continuous for all \( x \).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Asymptotic Behavior}
\begin{definition}
Asymptotic behavior refers to the behavior of a function as it approaches infinity or a particular value. A function may approach a finite value (horizontal asymptote), become infinitely large (vertical asymptote), or approach a certain path (slant asymptote).
\end{definition}

Understanding asymptotes is crucial in calculus for analyzing function limits and behavior at extreme values.

\paragraph{Types of Asymptotes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Horizontal asymptotes} occur when a function approaches a horizontal line as \( x \) goes to infinity or minus infinity.
    \item \textit{Vertical asymptotes} occur at values of \( x \) where the function tends towards infinity or minus infinity.
    \item \textit{Slant (or oblique) asymptotes} occur when the function approaches a line that is not horizontal as \( x \) goes to infinity or minus infinity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing Asymptotic Behavior:}
Consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x - 1} \). It has a vertical asymptote at \( x = 1 \) and a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 2 \).

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = \( x \),
    ylabel = {\( f(x) \)},

\end{exercise}

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Exercises on Asymptotic Behavior}

\begin{solution}[1]
For \( g(x) = \frac{3x^2 - x}{x^2 + 2} \), the horizontal asymptote is found by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator. Since they are the same, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{3}{1} = 3 \). There are no vertical asymptotes as the denominator is never zero.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[2]
The function \( h(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x}{x + 1} \) has a slant asymptote since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator. Dividing the numerator by the denominator gives the slant asymptote \( y = x + 2 \). There is no vertical asymptote as \( x + 1 \) does not equal zero for any real \( x \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
For \( f(x) = \frac{4x^3 - 2x + 1}{2x^2 - 3x + 5} \), the degree of the numerator is higher than the degree of the denominator, so there is no horizontal asymptote. For vertical asymptotes, solve \( 2x^2 - 3x + 5 = 0 \), which has no real solutions, so there are no vertical asymptotes.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[4]
The function \( p(x) = e^x \) does not have a horizontal asymptote as it grows exponentially and does not approach a finite value as \( x \) approaches infinity.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[5]
The function \( q(x) = \ln(x - 2) \) has a vertical asymptote at \( x = 2 \) since the logarithm becomes undefined at this point.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[6]
For \( r(x) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 4} \), the function has vertical asymptotes at \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \) where the denominator equals zero.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[7]
The function \( s(x) = \frac{x^2 - x + 1}{x - 3} \) has a slant asymptote since the degree of the numerator is one more than the denominator. Divide \( x^2 - x + 1 \) by \( x - 3 \) to find the slant asymptote equation.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[8]
The function \( t(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \) has a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \) as the value approaches zero when \( x \) approaches infinity.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[9]
The function \( u(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \) has a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \) as \( x \) approaches infinity since the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1 while \( x \) grows without bound.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[10]
The function \( v(x) = x\sin(\frac{1}{x}) \) for \( x \) approaching 0 does not have any asymptotes. As \( x \) approaches 0, \( \sin(\frac{1}{x}) \) oscillates rapidly, but the product with \( x \) ensures that the function remains bounded and approaches 0.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Periodicity and Symmetry}
\begin{definition}
A function is periodic if it repeats its values at regular intervals, and it is symmetric if it exhibits mirror symmetry about an axis or point.
\end{definition}

Periodicity and symmetry play important roles in understanding the behavior and properties of functions, especially in the fields of trigonometry and wave analysis.

\paragraph{Types of Symmetry:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A function is \textit{even} if \( f(-x) = f(x) \), showing symmetry about the y-axis.
    \item A function is \textit{odd} if \( f(-x) = -f(x) \), showing rotational symmetry about the origin.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing Periodic and Symmetric Functions:}
For instance, \( \sin(x) \) is an example of a periodic function, and \( x^2 \) is an example of an even function.

\end{solution}

\end{solution}


\section{Function Transformations}
\subsection{Translation and Scaling}
\begin{definition}
Translation shifts a function horizontally or vertically, while scaling changes its size.
\end{definition}

Translation and scaling are fundamental operations in function manipulation, allowing for adjustments in position and size of the graph of a function.

\paragraph{Types of Transformations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Horizontal Translation:} Shifting a function left or right. For instance, \( f(x) \) to \( f(x - h) \) shifts the function right by \( h \).
    \item \textit{Vertical Translation:} Moving a function up or down. For example, \( f(x) \) to \( f(x) + k \) raises the function by \( k \).
    \item \textit{Horizontal Scaling:} Stretching or compressing a function horizontally. \( f(x) \) to \( f(cx) \) scales the function horizontally.
    \item \textit{Vertical Scaling:} Altering the function's height. \( f(x) \) to \( cf(x) \) scales the function vertically.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Graphing Translated and Scaled Functions:}
Let's consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), its translation, and scaling.

\begin{definition}
Reflection inverts a function across a line, and rotation turns it around a point.
\end{definition}

Reflection and rotation are key transformations in function manipulation, changing the orientation of the graph of a function.

\paragraph{Types of Transformations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Reflection Across the y-axis:} Reflecting a function \( f(x) \) to \( f(-x) \) inverts it across the y-axis.
    \item \textit{Reflection Across the x-axis:} Reflecting a function \( f(x) \) to \( -f(x) \) inverts it across the x-axis.
    \item \textit{Rotation:} Rotation involves turning the graph of a function around a specific point, often the origin.

\chapter{Limits and Continuity - Detail}
\section{Introduction to Limits - Detail}
\subsection{Definition of a Limit - Detail}
\begin{definition}
The limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) is \( L \) if for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that \( |f(x) - L| < \epsilon \) whenever \( 0 < |x - a| < \delta \).
\end{definition}

This definition, known as the \(\epsilon-\delta\) definition of a limit, is fundamental in calculus. It formalizes the concept of approaching a value.

\paragraph{Understanding \(\epsilon-\delta\) Criteria:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\epsilon\) (epsilon) represents how close \( f(x) \) is to \( L \).
    \item \(\delta\) (delta) represents how close \( x \) is to \( a \).
    \item The statement means that \( f(x) \) gets arbitrarily close to \( L \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \).
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}

\paragraph{Graphical Representation:}
The following graph illustrates the concept using a function \( f(x) \) and a point \( a \).

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Exercises on the Definition of a Limit}

\begin{solution}[1]
To show the limit of \( f(x) = x^2 \) as \( x \) approaches 2 is 4, choose \(\delta = \min\left(1, \frac{\epsilon}{5}\right)\). For \( 0 < |x - 2| < \delta \), we have \( |f(x) - 4| = |x^2 - 4| = |(x - 2)(x + 2)| < 5|x - 2| < \epsilon \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[2]
For \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), as \( x \) approaches 0, the function values increase without bound. Therefore, no matter how small \(\delta\) is chosen, \( |f(x) - L| \) cannot be made less than any \(\epsilon > 0\). Hence, the limit does not exist.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[3]
To show the limit of \( g(x) = 3x + 2 \) as \( x \) approaches 4 is 14, choose \(\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{3}\). Then for \( 0 < |x - 4| < \delta \), we have \( |g(x) - 14| = |3x + 2 - 14| = 3|x - 4| < \epsilon \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[4]
For \( h(x) = \sqrt{x} \) and \( x \) approaching 9, choose \(\delta = \min\left(1, \epsilon^2\right)\). Then \( 0 < |x - 9| < \delta \) implies \( |\sqrt{x} - 3| < \epsilon \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[5]
For \( p(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \), factorize the numerator as \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \). The limit as \( x \) approaches 1 is 2, as \( p(x) \) simplifies to \( x + 1 \) and \( p(1) = 2 \). To show this, choose \(\delta = \epsilon\).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[6]
For \( q(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \) as \( x \) approaches 0, use the squeeze theorem. Since \( -1 \leq \sin(x) \leq 1 \), then \( -\frac{1}{x} \leq \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \leq \frac{1}{x} \). As \( x \) approaches 0, both bounds approach 0, so the limit is 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[7]
To show the limit of \( r(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \) as \( x \) approaches -3 is \(\frac{1}{9}\), choose \(\delta = \min\left(1, 3\epsilon\right)\). Then \( 0 < |x + 3| < \delta \) implies \( |r(x) - \frac{1}{9}| < \epsilon \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[8]
For \( s(x) = \frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 4} \), the function is undefined at \( x = 2 \), and the denominator approaches 0 as \( x \) approaches 2. Thus, the function values become unbounded, and the limit does not exist.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[9]
The limit of \( t(x) = x^3 \) as \( x \) approaches -1 is -1. Choose \(\delta = \sqrt[3]{\epsilon}\). Then \( 0 < |x + 1| < \delta \) implies \( |x^3 + 1| < \epsilon \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[10]
To show the limit of \( u(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x + 4}} \) as \( x \) approaches 0 is \(\frac{1}{2}\), choose \(\delta = \min\left(1, 4\epsilon^2\right)\). Then \( 0 < |x| < \delta \) implies \( |u(x) - \frac{1}{2}| < \epsilon \).
\end{solution}

\subsection{One-sided Limits}

In calculus, the concept of limits is essential for understanding the behavior of functions as they approach specific values. One-sided limits are a special case of limits that help us analyze the behavior of a function as it approaches a particular point from either the left or the right.

\begin{definition}
The one-sided limits of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the left (denoted as \( x \to a^- \)) and as \( x \) approaches \( a \) from the right (denoted as \( x \to a^+ \)) are the values the function approaches as \( x \) gets arbitrarily close to \( a \) from the left or the right, respectively. Mathematically, we write:

\[
\lim_{{x \to a^-}} f(x) = L^- \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{{x \to a^+}} f(x) = L^+
\]

where \( L^- \) and \( L^+ \) are the one-sided limits from the left and right, respectively.

\end{definition}

To visualize one-sided limits, consider the following example:

\begin{example}
Let's examine the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \). We want to find the one-sided limits of this function as \( x \) approaches \( 0 \).

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0^-}} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{{x \to 0^+}} \frac{1}{x} = +\infty
\]

As \( x \) approaches \( 0 \) from the left, \( \frac{1}{x} \) goes to negative infinity, and as \( x \) approaches \( 0 \) from the right, \( \frac{1}{x} \) goes to positive infinity.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-3,0) -- (3,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,-3) -- (0,3) node[left] {$f(x)$};

% Asymptotes
\draw[dashed] (-3,-3) -- (0,0);
\draw[dashed] (3,3) -- (0,0);

% Graph
\draw[domain=-3:-0.2,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{1/\x});
\draw[domain=0.2:3,smooth,variable=\x,red] plot ({\x},{1/\x});

% Labels
\draw (0.2,-0.1) -- (0.2,0.1) node[above] {$0$};
\draw (-0.2,-0.1) -- (-0.2,0.1) node[above] {$0$};
\draw (1,1.2) node[right] {$y=\frac{1}{x}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In the graph, the function approaches negative infinity as \( x \) approaches \( 0 \) from the left and positive infinity as \( x \) approaches \( 0 \) from the right, indicating the one-sided limits.
\end{example}

Understanding one-sided limits is crucial for analyzing the behavior of functions near specific points, especially when dealing with discontinuities or asymptotes.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

Let's work on some practice problems to reinforce our understanding of one-sided limits.

\begin{problem}
Find the one-sided limits of the following function as \( x \) approaches the given values:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 2^-}} (x^2 - 4x + 4) \)
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 2^+}} (x^2 - 4x + 4) \)
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 0^-}} \left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{|x|}\right) \)
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 0^+}} \left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{|x|}\right) \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function \( f(x) = \begin{cases}
  x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
  2x & \text{if } x \geq 0
\end{cases} \)
Find the following one-sided limits:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 0^-}} f(x) \)
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 0^+}} f(x) \)
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Determine if the following statements are true or false:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item If \( \lim_{{x \to a^-}} f(x) = \lim_{{x \to a^+}} f(x) \), then \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) exists.
  \item If \( \lim_{{x \to a^-}} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{{x \to a^+}} f(x) \) both exist and are finite, then \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) exists and is finite.
  \item If \( \lim_{{x \to a^-}} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{{x \to a^+}} f(x) \) both exist but are not equal, then \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) does not exist.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item True. If the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal, then the two-sided limit exists and is equal to that common value.
  \item True. If both one-sided limits exist and are finite, then the two-sided limit exists and is also finite.
  \item True. If the one-sided limits are not equal, it indicates a discontinuity at \( x = a \), so the two-sided limit does not exist.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

Now, you have a set of practice problems for students to work on to enhance their understanding of one-sided limits. The solutions to these problems are also provided to help students check their work.

  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 0^+}} \left(\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{|x|}\right) \)

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item True. If the left-hand and right-hand limits are equal, then the two-sided limit exists and is equal to that common value.
  \item True. If both one-sided limits exist and are finite, then the two-sided limit exists and is also finite.
  \item True. If the one-sided limits are not equal, it indicates a discontinuity at \( x = a \), so the two-sided limit does not exist.
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\subsection{Limits Involving Infinity}

Limits as \( x \) Approaches Infinity

When dealing with limits involving infinity, we are interested in understanding the behavior of a function as \( x \) approaches positive or negative infinity. Let's start by discussing limits as \( x \) approaches positive infinity (\( \infty \)).

\begin{definition}
A limit involving infinity is the value that \( f(x) \) approaches as \( x \) approaches positive infinity (\( x \to \infty \)), or as \( f(x) \) approaches infinity for some finite \( x \).
\end{definition}

To visualize this concept, consider the following example:

\begin{example}
Let's examine the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \). We want to find the limit of this function as \( x \) approaches positive infinity (\( x \to \infty \)).

\[
\lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{1}{x} = 0
\]

As \( x \) becomes larger and larger, \( \frac{1}{x} \) approaches zero.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (6,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4) node[left] {$f(x)$};

% Asymptote
\draw[dashed] (0,0) -- (6,0);

% Graph
\draw[domain=0.2:6,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{1/\x});

% Labels
\draw (0.2,-0.1) -- (0.2,0.1) node[above] {$0$};
\draw (1,1.5) node[right] {$y=\frac{1}{x}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In the graph, as \( x \) goes to infinity, \( \frac{1}{x} \) approaches \( 0 \), which is the limit.
\end{example}

Limits as \( x \) Approaches Negative Infinity

Similarly, we can analyze limits as \( x \) approaches negative infinity (\( x \to -\infty \)).

\begin{example}
Consider the function \( g(x) = e^x \). We want to find the limit of this function as \( x \) approaches negative infinity (\( x \to -\infty \)).

\[
\lim_{{x \to -\infty}} e^x = 0
\]

As \( x \) becomes more and more negative, \( e^x \) approaches zero.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-4,0) -- (2,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,4) node[left] {$g(x)$};

% Asymptote
\draw[dashed] (0,0) -- (-4,0);

% Graph
\draw[domain=-4:1,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{exp(\x)});

% Labels
\draw (-0.1,-0.1) -- (-0.1,0.1) node[above] {$0$};
\draw (1,3) node[right] {$y=e^x$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In the graph, as \( x \) goes to negative infinity, \( e^x \) approaches \( 0 \), which is the limit.
\end{example}

Understanding limits involving infinity is crucial for analyzing the long-term behavior of functions as \( x \) becomes infinitely large or small.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item To find \( \lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{3x + 2}{x - 1} \), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of \( x \):

  \]
  
  The limit is \( \infty \).

  \[
  \lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{2x^3 + 4x^2 - 3}{x^4 + 5x^2 + 1} = \lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{x^3(2 + \frac{4}{x} - \frac{3}{x^3})}{x^4(1 + \frac{5}{x^2} + \frac{1}{x^4})} = \lim_{{x \to \infty}} \frac{2 + 0 - 0}{1 + 0 + 0} = 2

  \item \( \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} e^x \)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item To find \( \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{2x^2 - 5x + 1}{3x^2 + 2} \), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of \( x \):
  
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{2x^2 - 5x + 1}{3x^2 + 2} = \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{x^2(2 - \frac{5}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2})}{x^2(3 + \frac{2}{x^2})} = \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{2 - 0 + 0}{3 + 0} = \frac{2}{3}
  \]
  
  The limit is \( \frac{2}{3} \).
  
  \item To find \( \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{4x}{x^2 + 1} \), we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of \( x \):
  
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{4x}{x^2 + 1} = \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{x(4)}{x^2(1 + \frac{1}{x^2})} = \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} \frac{4}{1 + 0} = 4
  \]
  
  The limit is \( 4 \).
  
  \item To find \( \lim_{{x \to -\infty}} e^x \), we know that as \( x \) approaches negative infinity, \( e^x \) approaches \( 0 \).

\subsection{Properties of Limits}

\textbf{Limit Laws}

In calculus, we often encounter limits of functions, and there are several standard limit laws that help us simplify the evaluation of limits. These laws include the sum law, product law, quotient law, and power law. Let's explore each of these limit laws and provide graphical interpretations.

\begin{theorem}
Standard limit laws include the sum law, product law, quotient law, and power law.
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Sum Law}

The sum law states that if \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x) \) both exist, then:

\[
\lim_{{x \to a}} [f(x) + g(x)] = \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) + \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x)
\]

In other words, the limit of the sum of two functions is equal to the sum of their limits. Let's illustrate this with a graphical example.

\begin{example}
Consider the functions \( f(x) = 2x \) and \( g(x) = x^2 \). We want to find \( \lim_{{x \to 2}} (2x + x^2) \).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-1,0) -- (4,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,8) node[left] {$y$};

% Functions
\draw[domain=0:3,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{2*\x}) node[right] {$f(x) = 2x$};
\draw[domain=0:3,smooth,variable=\x,red] plot ({\x},{\x*\x}) node[right] {$g(x) = x^2$};

% Limits
\draw[dashed] (2,0) -- (2,4) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) = 4$};
\draw[dashed] (2,0) -- (2,4) node[above right] {$\lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x) = 4$};

% Sum
\draw[dashed] (2,0) -- (2,8) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 2}} (f(x) + g(x)) = 8$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

As \( x \) approaches 2, both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) approach 4. Therefore, by the sum law:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} (2x + x^2) = \lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) + \lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x) = 4 + 4 = 8
\]
\end{example}

The sum law allows us to find limits of complex functions by breaking them down into simpler parts.

\textbf{Product Law}

The product law states that if \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x) \) both exist, then:

\[
\lim_{{x \to a}} [f(x) \cdot g(x)] = \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \cdot \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x)
\]

In other words, the limit of the product of two functions is equal to the product of their limits. Let's illustrate this with a graphical example.

\begin{example}
Consider the functions \( f(x) = x \) and \( g(x) = \frac{1}{x} \). We want to find \( \lim_{{x \to 1}} (x \cdot \frac{1}{x}) \).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-1,0) -- (3,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,-3) -- (0,3) node[left] {$y$};

% Functions
\draw[domain=0.1:2.9,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{\x}) node[right] {$f(x) = x$};
\draw[domain=0.1:2.9,smooth,variable=\x,red] plot ({\x},{1/\x}) node[right] {$g(x) = \frac{1}{x}$};

% Limits
\draw[dashed] (1,0) -- (1,1) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 1}} f(x) = 1$};
\draw[dashed] (1,0) -- (1,1) node[below right] {$\lim_{{x \to 1}} g(x) = 1$};

% Product
\draw[dashed] (1,0) -- (1,1) node[above right] {$\lim_{{x \to 1}} (f(x) \cdot g(x)) = 1$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

As \( x \) approaches 1, both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) approach 1. Therefore, by the product law:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 1}} (x \cdot \frac{1}{x}) = \lim_{{x \to 1}} f(x) \cdot \lim_{{x \to 1}} g(x) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
\]
\end{example}

The product law allows us to find limits of products of functions without directly evaluating the product.

\textbf{Quotient Law}

The quotient law states that if \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) and \( \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x) \) both exist and \( \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x) \neq 0 \), then:

\[
\lim_{{x \to a}} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x)}{\lim_{{x \to a}} g(x)}
\]

In other words, the limit of the quotient of two functions is equal to the quotient of their limits, provided that the limit of the denominator is not zero. Let's illustrate this with a graphical example.

\begin{example}
Consider the functions \( f(x) = x^2 \) and \( g(x) = x \). We want to find \( \lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{x^2}{x} \).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-1,0) -- (4,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,4) node[left] {$y$};

% Functions
\draw[domain=0:3,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{\x^2}) node[right] {$f(x) = x^2$};
\draw[domain=0:3,smooth,variable=\x,red] plot ({\x},{\x}) node[right] {$g(x) = x$};

% Limits
\draw[dashed] (2,0) -- (2,4) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) = 4$};
\draw[dashed] (2,0) -- (2,2) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x) = 2$};

% Quotient
\draw[dashed] (2,0) -- (2,2) node[above right] {$\lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

As \( x \) approaches 2, both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) approach 4 and 2, respectively. Therefore, by the quotient law:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{x^2}{x} = \frac{\lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x)}{\lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]
\end{example}

The quotient law helps us find limits involving fractions of functions by simplifying the process.

\textbf{Power Law}

The power law states that if \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \) exists and \( n \) is a positive integer, then:

\[
\lim_{{x \to a}} [f(x)]^n = [\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x)]^n
\]

In other words, the limit of a function raised to a power is equal to the function's limit raised to that power. Let's illustrate this with a graphical example.

\begin{example}
Consider the function \( f(x) = x \). We want to find \( \lim_{{x \to 3}} (x^2) \).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-1,0) -- (4,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,-1) -- (0,4) node[left] {$y$};

% Function
\draw[domain=0:3,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{\x}) node[right] {$f(x) = x$};

% Limit
\draw[dashed] (3,0) -- (3,3) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 3}} f(x) = 3$};

% Power
\draw[dashed] (3,0) -- (3,9) node[above left] {$\lim_{{x \to 3}} (f(x))^2 = (3)^2 = 9$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

As \( x \) approaches 3, \( f(x) \) approaches 3. Therefore, by the power law:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 3}} (x^2) = [\lim_{{x \to 3}} f(x)]^2 = (3)^2 = 9
\]
\end{example}

The power law simplifies the evaluation of limits involving powers of functions.

In summary, these standard limit laws (sum law, product law, quotient law, and power law) provide essential tools for evaluating limits and understanding the behavior of functions as they approach certain points.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}

  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 0}} (3x + 2x^2) = \lim_{{x \to 0}} 3x + \lim_{{x \to 0}} 2x^2 = 0 + 0 = 0
  \]
  
  \item Using the sum law:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 1}} (x^2 + x) = \lim_{{x \to 1}} x^2 + \lim_{{x \to 1}} x = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]
  
  \item Using the quotient law:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 2}} \left(\frac{x^2}{x + 1}\right) = \frac{\lim_{{x \to 2}} x^2}{\lim_{{x \to 2}} (x + 1)} = \frac{4}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
  \]
  
  \item Using the power law:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 2}} (x - 1)^3 = (\lim_{{x \to 2}} (x - 1))^3 = (2 - 1)^3 = 1
  \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limits. You may use any of the limit laws:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} (2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1) \)
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to 3}} \left(\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}\right) \)
  \item \( \lim_{{x \to -1}} \left(\frac{x^2 + 2x - 3}{x + 1}\right) \)

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item Using the sum law and power law:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 0}} (2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1) = \lim_{{x \to 0}} (2x^3) - \lim_{{x \to 0}} (3x^2) + \lim_{{x \to 0}} (4x) - \lim_{{x \to 0}} (1) = 0 - 0 + 0 - 1 = -1

  \item Using the quotient law:

  \]
  We can simplify further using factoring:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 3}} \left(\frac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3}\right) = \lim_{{x \to 3}} \left(\frac{(x + 3)(x - 3)}{x - 3}\right) = \lim_{{x \to 3}} (x + 3) = 6

  \]
  We can simplify further using factoring:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to -1}} \left(\frac{x^2 + 2x - 3}{x + 1}\right) = \lim_{{x \to -1}} \left(\frac{(x + 3)(x - 1)}{x + 1}\right) = \lim_{{x \to -1}} (x - 1) = -2
  \]
  
  \item Using the quotient law:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 4}} \left(\frac{x^3 - 64}{x - 4}\right) = \frac{\lim_{{x \to 4}} (x^3 - 64)}{\lim_{{x \to 4}} (x - 4)} = \frac{0}{0} \text{ (indeterminate)}
  \]
  We can simplify further using factoring:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 4}} \left(\frac{x^3 - 64}{x - 4}\right) = \lim_{{x \to 4}} \left(\frac{(x - 4)(x^2 + 4x + 16)}{x - 4}\right) = \lim_{{x \to 4}} (x^2 + 4x + 16) = 68
  \]

\subsection{Squeeze Theorem}

The Squeeze Theorem is a powerful tool for finding the limit of a function when it is bounded between two other functions whose limits are known. This theorem is particularly useful when direct substitution or algebraic simplification of a limit expression is difficult. The theorem can be stated as follows:

\begin{theorem}[Squeeze Theorem]
If \( f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x) \) for all \( x \) near \( a \), and the limits of \( f(x) \) and \( h(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) are equal, then the limit of \( g(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \) is the same:
\[
\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = \lim_{{x \to a}} h(x) = L \implies \lim_{{x \to a}} g(x) = L
\]
\end{theorem}

This theorem essentially states that if \( g(x) \) is "squeezed" between two functions \( f(x) \) and \( h(x) \), and both \( f(x) \) and \( h(x) \) approach the same limit \( L \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \), then \( g(x) \) also approaches \( L \) as \( x \) approaches \( a \).

Let's illustrate the Squeeze Theorem with a graphical example.

\begin{example}
Consider the functions \( f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \) and \( g(x) = 1 \) for \( x \neq 0 \). We want to find the limit of \( g(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 0.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Axis
\draw[->] (-3,0) -- (3,0) node[below] {$x$};
\draw[->] (0,-0.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left] {$y$};

% Function f(x)
% Splitting the domain to avoid x = 0
\draw[domain=-3:-0.1,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{sin(deg(\x))/\x});
\draw[domain=0.1:3,smooth,variable=\x,blue] plot ({\x},{sin(deg(\x))/\x}) node[right] {$f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}$};

% Function g(x)
\draw[dashed,red] (-3,1) -- (3,1) node[right] {$g(x) = 1$};

% Fill
% Adjusting the fill to avoid x = 0
\fill[gray!30] (-3,1) -- plot[domain=-3:-0.1,smooth,variable=\x] ({\x},{sin(deg(\x))/\x}) -- (-0.1,1) -- (0.1,1) -- plot[domain=0.1:3,smooth,variable=\x] ({\x},{sin(deg(\x))/\x}) -- (3,1) -- cycle;

% Labels
\draw (0.5,0.7) node[blue] {$f(x)$};
\draw (2,1.2) node[red] {$g(x)$};
\draw (-1.8,0.5) node {$\sin(x)/x \leq 1$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


As shown in the graph, for all \( x \neq 0 \), \( f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \) is bounded between -1 and 1. Additionally, \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1 \) as it is a well-known limit.

Therefore, by the Squeeze Theorem, since \( -1 \leq \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \leq 1 \) for all \( x \neq 0 \) and \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1 \), we conclude that \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} 1 = 1 \).

So, \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} g(x) = 1 \).
\end{example}

The Squeeze Theorem provides a powerful method to evaluate limits by establishing upper and lower bounds for a function and leveraging known limits of the bounding functions.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

Let's practice using the Squeeze Theorem to evaluate limits.

\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

  1 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems - Solutions}

Let's go through the solutions and explanations for the practice problems.

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit using the Squeeze Theorem:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To evaluate this limit, let's use the Squeeze Theorem. First, notice that for all \(x \neq 0\), we have \(-x^2 \leq x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \leq x^2\). Therefore, we can use the following inequalities:
\[
-x^2 \leq x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \leq x^2
\]
Next, consider the limits of the bounds as \(x\) approaches 0:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} (-x^2) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{{x \to 0}} (x^2) = 0
\]
Since both \(x^2\) and \(-x^2\) approach 0 as \(x\) approaches 0, we have:
\[
0 \leq \lim_{{x \to 0}} x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \leq 0
\]
By the Squeeze Theorem, the limit of \(x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 is 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Find the limit as \(x\) approaches 0 for the function \(f(x)\) defined as follows:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  x & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To find this limit, we can use the Squeeze Theorem. Consider the function \(f(x) = x\). We know that \(\lim_{{x \to 0}} x = 0\). 

Now, let's analyze the function \(g(x)\) defined as \(g(x) = 0\) for all \(x\). Clearly, \(\lim_{{x \to 0}} g(x) = 0\).

Since \(0 \leq f(x) \leq |x|\) for all \(x\), and both \(f(x)\) and \(|x|\) approach 0 as \(x\) approaches 0, we can apply the Squeeze Theorem to conclude that:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} f(x) = 0
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \left(\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)\right)
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
This limit is straightforward to evaluate. Notice that \(\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)\) is the identity for all \(x\). Therefore:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \left(\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)\right) = \lim_{{x \to 0}} 1 = 1
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Determine the limit as \(x\) approaches 0 for the function \(g(x)\) defined as follows:
\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{\sin(x)}{x} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  1 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To find this limit, we can use the Squeeze Theorem. Consider the function \(f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\). We know that \(\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1\) as it is a well-known limit.

Now, let's analyze the function \(h(x)\) defined as \(h(x) = 1\) for all \(x\). Clearly, \(\lim_{{x \to 0}} h(x) = 1\).

Since \(1 \leq f(x) \leq h(x)\) for all \(x\), and both \(f(x)\) and \(h(x)\) approach 1 as \(x\) approaches 0, we can apply the Squeeze Theorem to conclude that:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1
\]
\end{solution}


\subsection{Limits of Trigonometric Functions}

In calculus, we often encounter limits involving trigonometric functions. These limits are essential for understanding the behavior of functions near specific points and are used in various mathematical and scientific applications. Let's explore some important limits of trigonometric functions.

\begin{theorem}
One of the fundamental limits involving trigonometric functions is:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
\]
\end{theorem}

The limit \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1 \) is a crucial result and has significant implications in calculus. It's often referred to as the Sine Limit or Squeeze Theorem. To understand why this limit is equal to 1, let's consider a graphical representation.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel = \(x\),
    ylabel = \(f(x)\),
    xmin = -3, xmax = 3,
    ymin = -0.5, ymax = 1.5,
    unbounded coords=jump, % Skip over problematic points
  ]

  % Function f(x)
  \addplot [
    domain=-3:3,
    samples=200,
    color=blue,
    restrict y to domain=-10:10, % Restrict the y-range to avoid huge values
  ] 
  {sin(deg(\x))/\x};
  \addlegendentry{\(\frac{\sin x}{x}\)}

  % Point at x = 0
  \addplot [mark=*, color=blue] coordinates {(0,1)};

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}



As \(x\) approaches 0, the graph of \(y = \frac{\sin x}{x}\) approaches the horizontal line \(y = 1\). This visual representation helps illustrate why \( \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1 \).

The significance of this limit is profound, as it forms the basis for understanding the derivatives of trigonometric functions and plays a crucial role in calculus and mathematical analysis. It is often used as a building block for solving more complex limits involving trigonometric functions.

In addition to the limit mentioned above, there are other important limits involving trigonometric functions that are used in calculus, such as limits involving \(\sin x\), \(\cos x\), and \(\tan x\) as \(x\) approaches specific values. These limits provide insights into the behavior of trigonometric functions near certain points and are essential tools in calculus and mathematics.

In practice, these limits are applied to solve various real-world problems, including physics, engineering, and mathematical modeling. Understanding the limits of trigonometric functions is a fundamental skill for students and professionals in these fields.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

Let's practice evaluating limits of trigonometric functions.

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin 2x}{x}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Find the limit as \(x\) approaches \(0\) for the function \(f(x)\) defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{\sin 3x}{x} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}

\[
g(x) = \cos x
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to \frac{\pi}{4}}} \frac{\sin x - \cos x}{x - \frac{\pi}{4}}
\]
\end{problem}

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems - Solutions}

Let's go through the solutions and explanations for the practice problems.

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin 2x}{x}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To evaluate this limit, we can use the Squeeze Theorem. Notice that for all \(x \neq 0\), we have \(2x \leq \sin 2x \leq 2x\). Therefore, we can use the following inequalities:
\[
2x \leq \frac{\sin 2x}{x} \leq 2x
\]
Next, consider the limits of the bounds as \(x\) approaches 0:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} (2x) = 0
\]
Since both \(2x\) and \(-2x\) approach 0 as \(x\) approaches 0, we have:
\[
0 \leq \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin 2x}{x} \leq 0
\]
By the Squeeze Theorem, the limit of \(\frac{\sin 2x}{x}\) as \(x\) approaches 0 is 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Find the limit as \(x\) approaches \(0\) for the function \(f(x)\) defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{\sin 3x}{x} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To find this limit, we can directly apply the Sine Limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1
\]
In this case, \(3x\) is used instead of \(x\), but the form remains the same. Therefore:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{\sin 3x}{3x} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 3 = 1
\]
So, the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 is 1.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Determine the limit as \(x\) approaches \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) for the function \(g(x)\) given by:
\[
g(x) = \cos x
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To find this limit, we can directly substitute \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) into the function:
\[
\lim_{{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}}} \cos x = \cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0
\]
So, the limit of \(g(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) is 0.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the following limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to \frac{\pi}{4}}} \frac{\sin x - \cos x}{x - \frac{\pi}{4}}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To evaluate this limit, we can apply L'Hôpital's Rule, as the limit has the form \(\frac{0}{0}\). Taking the derivatives of the numerator and denominator:
\[
\lim_{{x \to \frac{\pi}{4}}} \frac{\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x - \cos x)}{\frac{d}{dx}(x - \frac{\pi}{4})} = \lim_{{x \to \frac{\pi}{4}}} \frac{(\cos x + \sin x)'}{1} = \frac{(\cos \frac{\pi}{4} + \sin \frac{\pi}{4})'}{1} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)}{1} = 1
\]
So, the limit of \(\frac{\sin x - \cos x}{x - \frac{\pi}{4}}\) as \(x\) approaches \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is 1.
\end{solution}

\section{Continuity - Detail}
\subsection{Continuity Definition and Examples}

In calculus, the concept of continuity is fundamental in understanding the behavior of functions. A function is considered continuous at a point if it satisfies the following criteria:

\begin{definition}
A function is continuous at a point \(x = a\) if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The function is defined at \(x = a\), meaning that \(f(a)\) is defined.
  \item The limit of the function as \(x\) approaches \(a\) exists, denoted as \(\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x)\).
  \item The limit \(\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x)\) is equal to the function value at \(x = a\), i.e., \(\lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) = f(a)\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The concept of continuity is crucial because it helps us determine when a function behaves smoothly without abrupt jumps or breaks. Let's explore some examples to illustrate continuity:

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(f(x) = x^2\). Is this function continuous at \(x = 2\)?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To check for continuity, we need to verify the three conditions of continuity.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f(2) = 2^2 = 4\), so the function is defined at \(x = 2\).
  \item Next, we find the limit as \(x\) approaches 2:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) = \lim_{{x \to 2}} x^2 = 2^2 = 4
  \]
  The limit exists and is equal to 4.
  \item Since \(f(2) = 4\) and \(\lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) = 4\), the limit equals the function value at \(x = 2\), and therefore, the function \(f(x) = x^2\) is continuous at \(x = 2\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Now, let's consider the function \(g(x) = \frac{1}{x}\). Is this function continuous at \(x = 0\)?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To check for continuity, we again examine the three conditions.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(g(0)\) is undefined since division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the function is not defined at \(x = 0\).
  \item We cannot compute the limit as \(x\) approaches 0 for \(g(x)\) since it's undefined at that point.
  \item Since the function is not defined at \(x = 0\), we cannot compare the limit and the function value. Therefore, the function \(g(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) is not continuous at \(x = 0\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Let's consider a piecewise function:
\[
h(x) =
\begin{cases}
  x + 2 & \text{if } x < 1 \\
  3x - 1 & \text{if } x \geq 1
\end{cases}
\]
Is this function continuous at \(x = 1\)?
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To determine continuity, we examine the three conditions for both branches of the piecewise function separately.

For \(x < 1\):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(h(x) = x + 2\), so it is defined at \(x = 1\).
  \item The limit as \(x\) approaches 1 for this branch:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 1^-}} (x + 2) = 1 + 2 = 3
  \]
  The limit exists and is equal to 3.
  \item \(h(1) = 1 + 2 = 3\).
\end{enumerate}

For \(x \geq 1\):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(h(x) = 3x - 1\), so it is defined at \(x = 1\).
  \item The limit as \(x\) approaches 1 for this branch:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 1^+}} (3x - 1) = 3(1) - 1 = 2
  \]
  The limit exists and is equal to 2.
  \item \(h(1) = 3(1) - 1 = 2\).
\end{enumerate}

Since both branches are defined and the limits equal the function values at \(x = 1\), the function \(h(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 1\).
\end{solution}

Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus, and understanding when a function is continuous at a point helps us analyze and work with functions in various applications.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

Let's practice applying the concept of continuity with some example problems:

\begin{problem}
Determine if the following function is continuous at \(x = 3\):
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 3 \\
  x^2 - 1 & \text{if } x \geq 3
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Find the values of \(a\) for which the function \(g(x) = ax^2 + 1\) is continuous at \(x = 2\).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function \(h(x) = \frac{1}{x}\). Determine all the values of \(x\) for which \(h(x)\) is continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Investigate the continuity of the function \(k(x)\) defined as:
\[
k(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \sin x & \text{if } x \neq \pi \\
  0 & \text{if } x = \pi
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems - Solutions}

Let's go through the solutions and explanations for the practice problems on continuity.

\begin{problem}
Determine if the following function is continuous at \(x = 3\):
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  2x + 1 & \text{if } x < 3 \\
  x^2 - 1 & \text{if } x \geq 3
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To check for continuity at \(x = 3\), we need to examine both branches of the function separately.

For \(x < 3\):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f(x) = 2x + 1\), so it is defined at \(x = 3\).
  \item The limit as \(x\) approaches 3 for this branch:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 3^-}} (2x + 1) = 2(3) + 1 = 7
  \]
  The limit exists and is equal to 7.
  \item \(f(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7\).
\end{enumerate}

For \(x \geq 3\):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f(x) = x^2 - 1\), so it is defined at \(x = 3\).
  \item The limit as \(x\) approaches 3 for this branch:
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to 3^+}} (x^2 - 1) = 3^2 - 1 = 8
  \]
  The limit exists and is equal to 8.
  \item \(f(3) = 3^2 - 1 = 8\).
\end{enumerate}

Since both branches are defined and the limits equal the function values at \(x = 3\), the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 3\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Find the values of \(a\) for which the function \(g(x) = ax^2 + 1\) is continuous at \(x = 2\).
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
For the function \(g(x) = ax^2 + 1\) to be continuous at \(x = 2\), it must satisfy the three conditions of continuity:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(g(2) = a(2)^2 + 1 = 4a + 1\) must be defined.
  \item The limit as \(x\) approaches 2, denoted as \(\lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x)\), must exist.
  \item \(\lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x)\) must be equal to \(g(2)\).
\end{enumerate}

First, we consider the limit:
\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} g(x) = \lim_{{x \to 2}} (ax^2 + 1) = 4a + 1
\]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = 2\), the limit must exist, and it must be equal to \(g(2)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
4a + 1 = 4a + 1
\]

No matter the value of \(a\), the function \(g(x)\) will be continuous at \(x = 2\) since the limit always exists and is equal to \(4a + 1\). So, there are no restrictions on the value of \(a\) for continuity at \(x = 2\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function \(h(x) = \frac{1}{x}\). Determine all the values of \(x\) for which \(h(x)\) is continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To find the values of \(x\) for which \(h(x)\) is continuous, we need to consider where the function is defined and check if the limit as \(x\) approaches each point exists.

The function \(h(x) = \frac{1}{x}\) is defined for all \(x\) except when \(x = 0\) since division by zero is undefined. Therefore, \(h(x)\) is not continuous at \(x = 0\) because it's not even defined at that point.

For all other values of \(x\), \(h(x)\) is continuous since it's defined, and the limit as \(x\) approaches any point \(x = a\) (where \(a \neq 0\)) exists and is equal to \(\frac{1}{a}\).

In summary, \(h(x)\) is continuous for all \(x\) except \(x = 0\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Investigate the continuity of the function \(k(x)\) defined as:
\[
k(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \sin x & \text{if } x \neq \pi \\
  0 & \text{if } x = \pi
\end{cases}
\]
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To investigate the continuity of \(k(x)\), we need to check the conditions of continuity at \(x = \pi\).

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(k(\pi) = 0\) is defined.
  \item The limit as \(x\) approaches \(\pi\):
  \[
  \lim_{{x \to \pi}} k(x) = \lim_{{x \to \pi}} \sin x = \sin(\pi) = 0
  \]
  The limit exists and is equal to 0.
  \item \(k(\pi) = 0\).
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, \(k(x)\) is continuous at \(x = \pi\).

For all other values of \(x\), \(k(x)\) is the sine function, which is known to be continuous everywhere.

In conclusion, \(k(x)\) is continuous for all \(x\).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Types of Discontinuities}

In calculus, discontinuities are points where a function behaves in a way that is not continuous, typically due to a sudden change or a point of undefined behavior. Discontinuities can be classified into three main types: removable, jump, and infinite discontinuities.

\begin{definition}
\textbf{Removable Discontinuity:} A removable discontinuity occurs at a point where the function is undefined or has a jump but can be made continuous by redefining the function value at that point.
\end{definition}

Consider the function \(f(x)\) defined as:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{\sin x}{x} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  2 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]


The graph of \(f(x)\) is shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel = \(x\),
    ylabel = \(f(x)\),
    xmin = -5, xmax = 5,
    ymin = -0.5, ymax = 2.5,
    legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
  ]
  \addplot [
    domain=-5:5,
    samples=200,
    color=blue,
  ]
  {x == 0 ? 1 : sin(deg(x))/x}; % Conditional function definition
  \addlegendentry{\(\frac{\sin x}{x}\)}

  \addplot [
    mark=*,
    color=red,
    only marks,
    mark size=2pt
  ]
  coordinates {(0,1)}; % Point to represent the limit at x = 0
  \addlegendentry{\(f(0) = 1\)}
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


At \(x = 0\), the function \(f(x)\) is undefined (division by zero). However, we can redefine \(f(0)\) as 2 to make it continuous at \(x = 0\). This is an example of a removable discontinuity.


\begin{definition}
\textbf{Jump Discontinuity:} A jump discontinuity occurs at a point where there is a sudden jump in the function's values from one side to the other.
\end{definition}

Consider the function \(g(x)\) defined as:

\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
  x + 1 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
  x^2 - 1 & \text{if } x \geq 0
\end{cases}
\]

The graph of \(g(x)\) is shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel = \(x\),
    ylabel = \(g(x)\),
    xmin = -2, xmax = 2,
    ymin = -1.5, ymax = 1.5,
    legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
  ]
  \addplot [
    domain=-2:0, % Exclusive upper bound
    samples=200,
    color=blue,
  ]
  {x + 1};
  \addlegendentry{\(x + 1\)}

  \addplot [
    domain=0:2, % Exclusive lower bound
    samples=200,
    color=blue,
  ]
  {x^2 - 1};
  \addlegendentry{\(x^2 - 1\)}
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


At \(x = 0\), there is a sudden jump in the function's values from \(g(0^-) = 1\) to \(g(0^+) = -1\). This is an example of a jump discontinuity.

\begin{definition}
\textbf{Infinite Discontinuity:} An infinite discontinuity occurs at a point where the function approaches positive or negative infinity as \(x\) approaches that point.
\end{definition}

Consider the function \(h(x)\) defined as:

\[
h(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{x} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]

The graph of \(h(x)\) is shown below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
    axis lines = center,
    xlabel = \(x\),
    ylabel = \(h(x)\),
    xmin = -5, xmax = 5,
    ymin = -5, ymax = 5,
    legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
  ]
  \addplot [
    domain=-5:-0.1, % Avoid getting too close to 0 from the left
    samples=200,
    color=blue,
  ]
  {1/x};
  \addlegendentry{\(\frac{1}{x}\)}

  \addplot [
    domain=0.1:5, % Avoid getting too close to 0 from the right
    samples=200,
    color=blue,
  ]
  {1/x};
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}


As \(x\) approaches 0 from the left (\(x \to 0^-\)), \(h(x)\) approaches negative infinity (\(h(x) \to -\infty\)), and as \(x\) approaches 0 from the right (\(x \to 0^+\)), \(h(x)\) approaches positive infinity (\(h(x) \to +\infty\)). This is an example of an infinite discontinuity.

\subsubsection*{Example Problems}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(f(x)\) defined as:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} & \text{if } x \neq 2 \\
  k & \text{if } x = 2
\end{cases}
\]

Determine the value of \(k\) that makes \(f(x)\) continuous at \(x = 2\).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = 2\), we need to ensure that the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 2 exists, and it must be equal to the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = 2\). 

First, let's calculate the limit as \(x\) approaches 2:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) = \lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}
\]

We can simplify this limit using algebraic manipulation:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} = \lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{(x + 2)(x - 2)}{x - 2}
\]

Now, we can cancel the common factor \((x - 2)\) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4
\]

So, the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 2 is 4. To make \(f(x)\) continuous at \(x = 2\), we set \(k\) to be equal to this limit:

\[
k = 4
\]

Therefore, \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 2\) when \(k = 4\).
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(g(x)\) defined as:

\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \sqrt{x} & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
  -\sqrt{-x} & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\]

Determine the type(s) of discontinuity, if any, at \(x = 0\).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To determine the type(s) of discontinuity at \(x = 0\), we need to analyze the behavior of \(g(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 from both the left (\(x \to 0^-\)) and the right (\(x \to 0^+\)).

As \(x\) approaches 0 from the left (\(x \to 0^-\)), \(g(x)\) approaches:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0^-}} g(x) = \lim_{{x \to 0^-}} (-\sqrt{-x}) = -\sqrt{0} = 0
\]

As \(x\) approaches 0 from the right (\(x \to 0^+\)), \(g(x)\) approaches:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0^+}} g(x) = \lim_{{x \to 0^+}} (\sqrt{x}) = \sqrt{0} = 0
\]

Both the left and right limits are equal and finite (\(0\)). Therefore, there is no jump or infinite discontinuity at \(x = 0\). However, \(g(x)\) is defined differently for \(x \geq 0\) and \(x < 0\), which means there is a removable discontinuity at \(x = 0\).

To make \(g(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\), we can redefine the function value at \(x = 0\) as \(g(0) = 0\). This removes the discontinuity, making \(g(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\).
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(h(x)\) defined as:

\[
h(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{x^2} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  k & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]

Determine the values of \(k\) that make \(h(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
For \(h(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = 0\), we need to ensure that the limit of \(h(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 exists, and it must be equal to the value of \(h(x)\) at \(x = 0\).

First, let's calculate the limit as \(x\) approaches 0:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} h(x) = \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{1}{x^2}
\]

As \(x\) approaches 0, the denominator \(x^2\) approaches 0, and the fraction \(\frac{1}{x^2}\) approaches positive infinity (\(+\infty\)). Therefore, the limit of \(h(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 is \(+\infty\).

To make \(h(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\), we set \(k\) to be equal to this limit:

\[
k = +\infty
\]

Therefore, \(h(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 0\) when \(k = +\infty\).
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Example Problems}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(f(x)\) defined as:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} & \text{if } x \neq 2 \\
  k & \text{if } x = 2
\end{cases}
\]

Determine the value of \(k\) that makes \(f(x)\) continuous at \(x = 2\).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = 2\), we need to ensure that the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 2 exists, and it must be equal to the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = 2\). 

First, let's calculate the limit as \(x\) approaches 2:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} f(x) = \lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2}
\]

We can simplify this limit using algebraic manipulation:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{x^2 - 4}{x - 2} = \lim_{{x \to 2}} \frac{(x + 2)(x - 2)}{x - 2}
\]

Now, we can cancel the common factor \((x - 2)\) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 2}} (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4
\]

So, the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 2 is 4. To make \(f(x)\) continuous at \(x = 2\), we set \(k\) to be equal to this limit:

\[
k = 4
\]

Therefore, \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 2\) when \(k = 4\).
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(g(x)\) defined as:

\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \sqrt{x} & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
  -\sqrt{-x} & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
\]

Determine the type(s) of discontinuity, if any, at \(x = 0\).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To determine the type(s) of discontinuity at \(x = 0\), we need to analyze the behavior of \(g(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 from both the left (\(x \to 0^-\)) and the right (\(x \to 0^+\)).

As \(x\) approaches 0 from the left (\(x \to 0^-\)), \(g(x)\) approaches:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0^-}} g(x) = \lim_{{x \to 0^-}} (-\sqrt{-x}) = -\sqrt{0} = 0
\]

As \(x\) approaches 0 from the right (\(x \to 0^+\)), \(g(x)\) approaches:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0^+}} g(x) = \lim_{{x \to 0^+}} (\sqrt{x}) = \sqrt{0} = 0
\]

Both the left and right limits are equal and finite (\(0\)). Therefore, there is no jump or infinite discontinuity at \(x = 0\). However, \(g(x)\) is defined differently for \(x \geq 0\) and \(x < 0\), which means there is a removable discontinuity at \(x = 0\).

To make \(g(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\), we can redefine the function value at \(x = 0\) as \(g(0) = 0\). This removes the discontinuity, making \(g(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\).
\end{solution}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \(h(x)\) defined as:

\[
h(x) =
\begin{cases}
  \frac{1}{x^2} & \text{if } x \neq 0 \\
  k & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
\]

Determine the values of \(k\) that make \(h(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
For \(h(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = 0\), we need to ensure that the limit of \(h(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 exists, and it must be equal to the value of \(h(x)\) at \(x = 0\).

First, let's calculate the limit as \(x\) approaches 0:

\[
\lim_{{x \to 0}} h(x) = \lim_{{x \to 0}} \frac{1}{x^2}
\]

As \(x\) approaches 0, the denominator \(x^2\) approaches 0, and the fraction \(\frac{1}{x^2}\) approaches positive infinity (\(+\infty\)). Therefore, the limit of \(h(x)\) as \(x\) approaches 0 is \(+\infty\).

To make \(h(x)\) continuous at \(x = 0\), we set \(k\) to be equal to this limit:

\[
k = +\infty
\]

Therefore, \(h(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 0\) when \(k = +\infty\).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Intermediate Value Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
If a function is continuous on a closed interval \([a, b]\) and \( N \) is any number between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \), then there exists a number \( c \) in the interval such that \( f(c) = N \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
A function \( f \) is said to be continuous on a closed interval \([a, b]\) if it is continuous at every point in the interval.
\end{definition}

\begin{discussion}
The Intermediate Value Theorem is a fundamental result in calculus that asserts the existence of a point in a continuous function where the function takes on a given value. This theorem is particularly useful in proving the existence of roots.
\end{discussion}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \) on the interval \([-3, 3]\). Since \( f(-3) = 5 \) and \( f(3) = 5 \), and \( 0 \) is between \( 5 \) and \( 5 \), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a \( c \) in \([-3, 3]\) such that \( f(c) = 0 \).

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Practice Problems on Intermediate Value Theorem}

\begin{solution}[\textbf{Problem 1}]
To show that \( h(x) = 3x^3 - 2x + 1 \) has at least one root in the interval \([-2, 2]\), we need to check the values of \( h \) at the endpoints and apply the IVT.

At \( x = -2 \), \( h(-2) = 3(-2)^3 - 2(-2) + 1 = -24 + 4 + 1 = -19 \).

At \( x = 2 \), \( h(2) = 3(2)^3 - 2(2) + 1 = 24 - 4 + 1 = 21 \).

Since \( h(-2) < 0 \) and \( h(2) > 0 \), and \( h \) is a polynomial (hence continuous), by the IVT, there is at least one root of \( h \) in the interval \([-2, 2]\).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[\textbf{Problem 2}]
For \( k(x) = \cos(x) - x \), we evaluate \( k \) at \( 0 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{2} \):

At \( x = 0 \), \( k(0) = \cos(0) - 0 = 1 \).

At \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( k(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) - \frac{\pi}{2} = -\frac{\pi}{2} \).

Since \( k(0) > 0 \) and \( k(\frac{\pi}{2}) < 0 \), and \( k \) is continuous, there must be a root of \( k \) in the interval \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) by the IVT.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[\textbf{Problem 3}]
To apply the IVT to \( f(x) = e^x - 4x \) in the interval [1, 2], we first evaluate \( f \) at the endpoints:

At \( x = 1 \), \( f(1) = e^1 - 4(1) = e - 4 \).

At \( x = 2 \), \( f(2) = e^2 - 4(2) = e^2 - 8 \).

Since \( e < 4 \) and \( e^2 > 8 \), it follows that \( f(1) < 0 \) and \( f(2) > 0 \). Hence, by the IVT, there is a root of \( f \) between 1 and 2.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[\textbf{Problem 4}]
For the function \( m(x) = x^5 - 5x + 4 \), we need to find an interval of length 1 where \( m \) has a root. 

Consider the intervals \([-1, 0]\) and \([0, 1]\). We compute \( m(-1) \), \( m(0) \), and \( m(1) \):

\( m(-1) = (-1)^5 - 5(-1) + 4 = -1 + 5 + 4 = 8 \).

\( m(0) = 0^5 - 5(0) + 4 = 4 \).

\( m(1) = 1^5 - 5(1) + 4 = 0 \).

Since \( m(-1) > 0 \) and \( m(0) < 0 \), there is at least one root in \([-1, 0]\) by the IVT. Similarly, since \( m(0) < 0 \) and \( m(1) = 0 \), there is a root at \( x = 1 \) in \([0, 1]\).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[\textbf{Problem 5}]
For \( p(x) = \ln(x) - x^2 + 3 \), evaluate \( p \) at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \):

\( p(1) = \ln(1) - 1^2 + 3 = 0 - 1 + 3 = 2 \).

\( p(4) = \ln(4) - 4^2 + 3 = \ln(4) - 16 + 3 = \ln(4) - 13 \).

Since \( \ln(4) < 13 \), it follows that \( p(4) < 0 \). Given \( p(1) > 0 \) and \( p(4) < 0 \), and \( p \) is continuous on \([1, 4]\), by the IVT, there is at least one root of \( p \) in this interval.
\end{solution}

\chapter{The Derivative - Detail}
\section{Understanding Derivatives}
\subsection{Derivative Definition and Notation}

\begin{definition}
The derivative of a function \( f \) at a point \( a \) is defined as \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\), if this limit exists. This derivative is denoted as \( f'(a) \) or \( \frac{df}{dx}(a) \).
\end{definition}

The derivative of a function at a point is a fundamental concept in calculus. It represents the rate at which the function's value changes at that point. Geometrically, the derivative corresponds to the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point.

\begin{example}[Graphical Representation of Derivative]
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) and the point \( a = 2 \). The derivative at this point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \( f \) at \( x = 2 \).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines = center,
        xlabel = \( x \),
        ylabel = \( y \),
        xmin = 0, xmax = 4,
        ymin = 0, ymax = 5,
        legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
    ]
    % Plot function
    \addplot [
        domain=0:4,
        samples=100,
        color=blue,
    ] 
    {x^2};
    \addlegendentry{\( f(x) = x^2 \)}

    % Tangent line at x = 2
    \addplot [
        domain=1:3,
        samples=2,
        color=red,
    ] 
    {4*x - 4}; % Tangent line equation
    \addlegendentry{Tangent at \( x = 2 \)}

    % Point at x = 2
    \addplot [holdot] coordinates {(2,4)};
    \node[label={above:\( (2, f(2)) \)},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:2,4) {};

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this case, the slope of the tangent line (the derivative) at \( x = 2 \) can be calculated as:
\[ f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(2+h)^2 - 4}{h} = 4. \]
Thus, the derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 \) at \( x = 2 \) is 4.
\end{example}

The concept of the derivative is widely used in various fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, and beyond. It provides a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding how functions behave and change.

\subsubsection*{Exercises on Derivatives}

The following exercises will help solidify your understanding of calculating derivatives. Try to solve them and then check your answers against the provided solutions.

\begin{exercise}
Find the derivative of the function \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7 \) at \( x = 1 \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Using the definition of the derivative,
\[ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \]
for \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7 \), we find
\[ f'(1) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{3(1+h)^3 - 2(1+h)^2 + 5(1+h) - 7 - (3 - 2 + 5 - 7)}{h}. \]
Simplifying and evaluating this limit gives the derivative at \( x = 1 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Determine the slope of the tangent line to the curve \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \) at \( x = 4 \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative of \( g(x) \) at \( x = 4 \). The derivative is
\[ g'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}. \]
Therefore, the slope at \( x = 4 \) is \( g'(4) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{4}. \)
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
Calculate the derivative of \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \) at any point \( x \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The derivative of \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \) is
\[ h'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{(x+h)^2} - \frac{1}{x^2}}{h}. \]
Simplifying this expression will give the general formula for the derivative of \( h(x) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
What is the derivative of the constant function \( k(x) = 17 \)?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
For any constant function \( k(x) = c \), where \( c \) is a constant, the derivative is zero. Hence, \( k'(x) = 0 \).
\end{solution}

These exercises cover a range of fundamental concepts in differentiation. By working through these problems, you'll gain a better understanding of how to compute derivatives and interpret their geometric meaning.

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Exercises on Derivatives}

Here are the detailed solutions and explanations for the exercises on derivatives.

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 1]
To find the derivative of the function \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7 \) at \( x = 1 \), we first calculate the derivative of \( f(x) \) and then evaluate it at \( x = 1 \).

The derivative \( f'(x) \) is calculated using standard differentiation rules:
\[ f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(3x^3) - \frac{d}{dx}(2x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(5x) - \frac{d}{dx}(7) = 9x^2 - 4x + 5. \]

Evaluating this at \( x = 1 \) gives:
\[ f'(1) = 9(1)^2 - 4(1) + 5 = 9 - 4 + 5 = 10. \]

Therefore, the derivative of \( f(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) is \( 10 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 2]
The slope of the tangent line to the curve \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \) at \( x = 4 \) is given by \( g'(4) \).

First, find the derivative \( g'(x) \):
\[ g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(\sqrt{x}) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}. \]

Now, evaluate \( g'(x) \) at \( x = 4 \):
\[ g'(4) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{4}. \]

The slope of the tangent line at \( x = 4 \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 3]
To calculate the derivative of \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \) at any point \( x \), we use the power rule for differentiation:

\[ h'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^{-2}) = -2x^{-3} = -\frac{2}{x^3}. \]

So, the derivative of \( h(x) \) is \( -\frac{2}{x^3} \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 4]
The derivative of a constant function \( k(x) = 17 \) is zero. This is because the rate of change of a constant function is always zero. Hence, \( k'(x) = 0 \).
\end{solution}

These solutions provide a step-by-step approach to understanding and solving basic derivative problems. They demonstrate the application of differentiation rules and the interpretation of derivatives in various contexts.

\subsection{Interpreting Derivatives}

\begin{discussion}
The derivative of a function at a point provides critical information about the behavior of the function at that point. It gives the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph and represents the rate of change of the function with respect to its variable. This can be interpreted in various ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Slope of Tangent:} The derivative at a point \(a\) gives the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. A positive derivative indicates an increasing function, while a negative derivative indicates a decreasing function.
    \item \textbf{Rate of Change:} The derivative is a measure of how fast the function's value is changing at that point. It is especially important in physics for understanding velocity and acceleration.
\end{itemize}
\end{discussion}

\subsection{Graphical Interpretation}
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The derivative of \( f \) at a point \( x = a \) is given by \( f'(a) = 2a \). This derivative represents the slope of the tangent line at \( x = a \).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines = middle,
        xlabel = \(x\),
        ylabel = \(f(x)\),
        xmin = -1, xmax = 3,
        ymin = -1, ymax = 5,
        legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
    ]
    % Function f(x)
    \addplot [
        domain=-1:3,
        samples=100,
        color=blue,
    ] 
    {x^2};
    \addlegendentry{\(f(x) = x^2\)}

    % Tangent line at x = 1
    \addplot [
        domain=0:2,
        samples=2,
        color=red,
    ] 
    {2*x - 1}; % y = f'(1)(x - 1) + f(1)
    \addlegendentry{Tangent at \(x = 1\)}

    % Point at x = 1
    \addplot[holdot] coordinates {(1,1)};
    \node[label={below right:\( (1, f(1)) \)},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:1,1) {};

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this graph, the tangent line at \( x = 1 \) has a slope of \( f'(1) = 2 \), illustrating how the derivative provides the slope at a specific point on the curve.

\subsection{Practical Implications}
Understanding derivatives is crucial in many scientific and engineering fields. For instance, in physics, the derivative of position with respect to time gives the velocity, and the derivative of velocity gives acceleration. In economics, the derivative can represent the rate of change in cost or revenue.

Interpreting derivatives thus provides a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting the behavior of various phenomena described mathematically.

\subsubsection*{Exercises on Interpreting Derivatives}

The following exercises are designed to help you apply and deepen your understanding of derivatives.

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Find the points on the curve \( y = x^4 - 4x^3 \) where the tangent is horizontal.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Solutions to Exercises on Interpreting Derivatives}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 1]
First, find the derivative \( f'(x) \) of \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 5 \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x. \]
Then, find the slope of the tangent line at \( x = 2 \):
\[ f'(2) = 3(2)^2 - 6(2) = 12 - 12 = 0. \]
The slope of the tangent line at \( x = 2 \) is \( 0 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 2]
Find the derivative of \( g(x) = \frac{1}{x} \):
\[ g'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}. \]
The function is increasing where \( g'(x) > 0 \) and decreasing where \( g'(x) < 0 \). Since \( g'(x) \) is always negative, \( g(x) \) is always decreasing.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 3]
The velocity of the particle is the derivative of \( s(t) \):
\[ s'(t) = 4t - 3. \]
The velocity at \( t = 4 \) is:
\[ s'(4) = 4(4) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13. \]
The velocity at \( t = 4 \) is \( 13 \) units per time interval.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 4]
Find \( y' \) and set it equal to \( 0 \) to find points where the tangent is horizontal:
\[ y' = 4x^3 - 12x^2, \]
\[ 0 = 4x^3 - 12x^2. \]
Solving this gives the points where the tangent is horizontal.
\end{solution}

These exercises and solutions explore various aspects of derivatives, from the slope of tangent lines to real-world applications such as motion analysis.

\subsection{Derivative as a Function}

\begin{definition}
The derivative of a function \( f \), denoted as \( f'(x) \) or \( \frac{df}{dx} \), is a function that assigns to each point \( x \) in the domain of \( f \) the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \( f \) at \( x \). This function provides a means to understand how \( f \) changes at each point.
\end{definition}

\subsection{A Derivative's Graphical Interpretation}
Consider a function \( f(x) \) and its derivative \( f'(x) \). The graph of \( f'(x) \) can be understood as a plot of the slopes of the tangents to the graph of \( f(x) \) at each point.

% Example function and its derivative
\example{Let \( f(x) = x^2 \). The derivative function is \( f'(x) = 2x \).}

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines = middle,
        xlabel = \(x\),
        ylabel = \(y\),
        xmin = -2, xmax = 2,
        ymin = -2, ymax = 4,
        legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
    ]
    % Original function f(x)
    \addplot [
        domain=-2:2,
        samples=100,
        color=blue,
    ] 
    {x^2};
    \addlegendentry{\(f(x) = x^2\)}

    % Derivative function f'(x)
    \addplot [
        domain=-2:2,
        samples=100,
        color=red,
    ] 
    {2*x};
    \addlegendentry{\(f'(x) = 2x\)}

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this graph, the blue curve represents the function \( f(x) = x^2 \), and the red curve represents its derivative \( f'(x) = 2x \). The derivative graph shows the slope of the tangent to \( f(x) \) at each point \( x \).

\subsection{Significance of the Derivative Function}
The derivative function \( f'(x) \) provides valuable information about the behavior of \( f(x) \):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Where \( f'(x) > 0 \), \( f(x) \) is increasing.
    \item Where \( f'(x) < 0 \), \( f(x) \) is decreasing.
    \item Where \( f'(x) = 0 \), \( f(x) \) may have a local maximum, minimum, or inflection point.
\end{itemize}

Understanding the derivative as a function itself allows for a deeper analysis of the original function, particularly in understanding its growth, decay, and points of extrema.

\subsubsection*{Exercises on Derivative as a Function}

The following exercises are designed to help you apply and deepen your understanding of the derivative as a function.

\begin{exercise}
Find the derivative function \( f'(x) \) for \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x + 1 \). Then, determine the intervals where \( f(x) \) is increasing and decreasing.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Given the function \( g(x) = \cos(x) \), sketch the graph of \( g \) and its derivative \( g'(x) \) on the same axes. Indicate points of maximum, minimum, and points where the tangent is horizontal.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
For the function \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \), compute the derivative \( h'(x) \). Use the derivative to discuss the concavity of the function.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider \( f(x) = e^x \). Find \( f'(x) \) and describe how the behavior of \( f'(x) \) relates to the behavior of \( f(x) \).
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Solutions to Exercises on Derivative as a Function}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 1]
The derivative of \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x + 1 \) is \( f'(x) = 9x^2 - 2 \). 
To find where \( f(x) \) is increasing or decreasing, determine the sign of \( f'(x) \) for different intervals. \( f(x) \) is increasing where \( f'(x) > 0 \) and decreasing where \( f'(x) < 0 \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 2]
The derivative of \( g(x) = \cos(x) \) is \( g'(x) = -\sin(x) \). Sketching \( g \) and \( g' \) together, you'll notice that \( g'(x) \) is zero at the maxima and minima of \( g(x) \), indicating points where the tangent to \( g(x) \) is horizontal.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 3]
The derivative of \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \) is \( h'(x) = -\frac{2}{x^3} \). The concavity of \( h(x) \) is determined by the sign of \( h'(x) \). Since \( h'(x) \) is always negative, \( h(x) \) is concave down for its entire domain.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 4]
The derivative of \( f(x) = e^x \) is \( f'(x) = e^x \), which is the same as \( f(x) \). This means that the rate of change of \( e^x \) is equal to its value at any point, showing an exponential rate of increase.
\end{solution}

These exercises and solutions provide a practical application of the concept of the derivative as a function, enhancing understanding through specific examples.

\section{Techniques of Differentiation}
\subsection{Product Rule and Quotient Rule}
\begin{theorem}
The Product Rule states that for two differentiable functions \( f \) and \( g \), the derivative of their product \( fg \) is given by \( (fg)' = f'g + fg' \). The Quotient Rule states that for two differentiable functions \( f \) and \( g \) (with \( g \) not equal to zero), the derivative of their quotient \( \frac{f}{g} \) is given by \( \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2} \).
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Graphical Representation of the Product Rule}
Consider two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). The graph below illustrates the product rule by showing \( f(x) \), \( g(x) \), and their product \( f(x)g(x) \) along with their derivatives.

    \addlegendentry{\(f(x)g(x)\)}

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection{Graphical Representation of the Quotient Rule}
Similarly, for the quotient rule, consider functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). The graph below illustrates the quotient rule by showing \( f(x) \), \( g(x) \), and their quotient \( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \) along with their derivatives.

% Example functions for Quotient Rule

    ] 
    {x^3};
    \addlegendentry{\(f(x) = x^3\)}

    % g(x) = x + 1
    \addplot [
        domain=-2:2,
        samples=100,
        color=red,
    ] 
    {x + 1};
    \addlegendentry{\(g(x) = x + 1\)}

    % Quotient f(x)/g(x)
    \addplot [
        domain=-1.9:1.9, % Avoid division by zero
        samples=100,

    {x^3/(x + 1)};
    \addlegendentry{\(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\)}

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

These graphical representations help in visualizing how the derivatives of the product and quotient of two functions are related to the derivatives of the individual functions. They also highlight the importance of understanding these rules for effective differentiation of more complex functions.

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 4]
For \( k(x) = \frac{\tan x}{x^2 + 1} \), use the Quotient Rule:
\[ k'(x) = \frac{(\tan x)'(x^2 + 1) - \tan x (x^2 + 1)'}{(x^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{\sec^2 x (x^2 + 1) - 2x \tan x}{(x^2 + 1)^2}. \]
\end{solution}

\subsection{Chain Rule}

\begin{theorem}
If a function \( y \) is a function of \( u \), which is in turn a function of \( x \), then the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is given by the product of the derivatives of \( y \) with respect to \( u \) and \( u \) with respect to \( x \), that is, \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \).
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection*{Application of the Chain Rule}
The Chain Rule is particularly useful when dealing with composite functions, where one function is nested within another.

\example{Consider \( y = \sin(u) \) and \( u = x^2 + 1 \). We want to find \( \frac{dy}{dx} \).}

Applying the Chain Rule, we have:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} = \cos(u) \cdot 2x = \cos(x^2 + 1) \cdot 2x. \]

\subsection{Chain Rule Graphical Representation}
To visualize the Chain Rule, we can plot both the inner function \( u(x) = x^2 + 1 \) and the composite function \( y(x) = \sin(x^2 + 1) \), along with their derivatives.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines = middle,
        xlabel = \(x\),
        ylabel = \(y\),
        xmin = -2, xmax = 2,
        ymin = -2, ymax = 2,
        legend style={at={(0.95,0.95)}, anchor=north east}
    ]
    % u(x) = x^2 + 1
    \addplot [
        domain=-2:2,
        samples=100,
        color=blue,
    ] 
    {x^2 + 1};
    \addlegendentry{\(u(x) = x^2 + 1\)}

    % y(x) = sin(u(x))
    \addplot [
        domain=-2:2,
        samples=100,
        color=red,
    ] 
    {sin(deg(x^2 + 1))};
    \addlegendentry{\(y(x) = \sin(x^2 + 1)\)}

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{Higher-Order Derivatives}

\begin{definition}
The \( n \)-th order derivative of a function \( f \), denoted \( f^{(n)} \), is the derivative of \( f^{(n-1)} \). It represents the rate of change of the \( (n-1) \)-th derivative of \( f \).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Understanding Higher-Order Derivatives}
Higher-order derivatives can be seen as successive rates of change. The second derivative, \( f''(x) \), often represents the curvature or concavity of the function \( f(x) \). Higher-order derivatives have applications in physics, engineering, and other fields.

\example{Consider the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x \). Find the first, second, and third derivatives.}

\begin{solution}
The first derivative \( f'(x) \) represents the rate of change of \( f \) with respect to \( x \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2. \]

The second derivative \( f''(x) \) shows how the slope of \( f(x) \) changes:
\[ f''(x) = 6x - 6. \]

The third derivative \( f'''(x) \) gives the rate of change of the curvature of \( f(x) \):
\[ f'''(x) = 6. \]
\end{solution}

\subsection{L'Hôpital's Rule for Indeterminate Forms}
\label{subsec:lhospitals_rule}

\begin{theorem}[L'Hôpital's Rule]
If the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are differentiable and \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0 \) or \( \pm \infty \), and if \( \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \) exists or equals \( \pm \infty \), then
\[ \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}. \]
\end{theorem}

\subsubsection*{Graphical Illustration}
To understand L'Hôpital's Rule, let's consider the indeterminate form \(\frac{0}{0}\). Suppose \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) approach 0 as \( x \) approaches \( c \), making \( \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \) indeterminate at \( x = c \).

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Graphical interpretation of L'Hôpital's Rule}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Applications}
L'Hôpital's Rule is particularly useful in calculus for resolving limits that result in indeterminate forms like \( \frac{0}{0} \) or \( \frac{\infty}{\infty} \). It simplifies complex limit evaluations, especially when direct substitution in the limit leads to an indeterminate form.

\subsubsection*{Examples}
\begin{example}
Evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \).

\textbf{Solution:}
Direct substitution gives \(\frac{0}{0}\), an indeterminate form. Applying L'Hôpital's Rule:
\[ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{1} = \cos(0) = 1. \]
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Find \( \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^x}{x^2} \).

\textbf{Solution:}
Both numerator and denominator approach infinity as \( x \to \infty \). Applying L'Hôpital's Rule twice:
\[ \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^x}{x^2} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^x}{2x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^x}{2} = \infty. \]
\end{example}

\subsubsection*{Conclusion}
L'Hôpital's Rule streamlines the process of evaluating limits that lead to indeterminate forms, which are common in calculus. Its application requires understanding of derivatives and their properties.

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}
To further strengthen your understanding of L'Hôpital's Rule, try solving the following problems:

\begin{problem}
Evaluate the limit: \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Find the limit: \( \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Determine \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(2x)}{3x} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Compute the limit: \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln(x) \).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{x^2} \).
\end{problem}

\subsubsection*{Hints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For problems that result in the \(\frac{0}{0}\) indeterminate form, apply L'Hôpital's Rule by differentiating the numerator and denominator separately.
  \item If the indeterminate form persists after the first application of the rule, you may need to apply L'Hôpital's Rule multiple times.
  \item Remember that understanding the behavior of functions as they approach a point is key to correctly applying L'Hôpital's Rule.
\end{itemize}

These problems are designed to cover various scenarios where L'Hôpital's Rule can be applied. They will help you develop a deeper understanding of how to deal with indeterminate forms in calculus.

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Practice Problems}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 1]
Evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} \).

\textit{Solution:}
Applying L'Hôpital's Rule, we differentiate the numerator and denominator:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x}{1} = e^0 = 1.
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 2]
Find \( \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \).

\textit{Solution:}
Using L'Hôpital's Rule:

\[
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1/x}{1} = 0.
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 3]
Determine \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(2x)}{3x} \).

\textit{Solution:}
Applying L'Hôpital's Rule:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(2x)}{3x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{2\cos(2x)}{3} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 4]
Compute \( \lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln(x) \).

\textit{Solution:}
This is an indeterminate form of type \( 0 \cdot (-\infty) \). Rewriting the expression:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} x \ln(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\ln(x)}{1/x}.
\]

Now applying L'Hôpital's Rule:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\ln(x)}{1/x} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1/x}{-1/x^2} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} -x = 0.
\]
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 5]
Evaluate \( \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{x^2} \).

\textit{Solution:}
Using L'Hôpital's Rule:

\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1 - \cos(x)}{x^2} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{2x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
\end{solution}

These solutions provide step-by-step application of L'Hôpital's Rule to solve the given limits. They illustrate the procedure of differentiating the numerator and denominator to resolve indeterminate forms.

\subsection{Implicit Differentiation}

\begin{method}
Implicit differentiation is used when a function is given in an implicit form \( F(x, y) = 0 \) rather than the explicit form \( y = f(x) \). It involves differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to \( x \) and solving for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \).
\end{method}

\subsection{Principle of Implicit Differentiation}
In implicit differentiation, each term involving \( y \) is differentiated using the chain rule, as \( y \) is a function of \( x \).

\example{Differentiate the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \) implicitly.}

\begin{solution}
Differentiating both sides with respect to \( x \):
\[ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(25), \]
\[ 2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0. \]
Solving for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}. \]
\end{solution}

\subsection{Graphical Representation of Implicit Functions}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = \(x\),
    ylabel = \(y\),

\addlegendentry{\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\)}

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

This graph shows the circle defined by the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \). Implicit differentiation helps find the slope of the tangent at any point on this curve.

\subsection{Practical Engineering Example: Pressure and Volume in Thermodynamics}

\begin{example}
In thermodynamics, the relationship between the pressure \( P \), volume \( V \), and temperature \( T \) of a gas is often described by the equation \( PV = nRT \), where \( n \) is the number of moles of the gas and \( R \) is the universal gas constant. If the temperature is held constant, find the rate at which pressure changes with respect to volume.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Given the equation \( PV = nRT \) with constant \( T \), we differentiate implicitly with respect to \( V \):
\[ P\frac{dV}{dV} + V\frac{dP}{dV} = 0, \]
\[ P + V\frac{dP}{dV} = 0, \]
\[ \frac{dP}{dV} = -\frac{P}{V}. \]
This result indicates that the rate at which pressure changes with respect to volume is inversely proportional to the volume itself, assuming temperature remains constant. This principle is crucial in understanding how gases behave under compression or expansion in various engineering applications.
\end{solution}

\begin{discussion}
This example demonstrates the application of implicit differentiation in the field of thermodynamics, specifically in understanding how the properties of gases change under different conditions. Such principles are fundamental in engineering disciplines, especially in mechanical and chemical engineering.
\end{discussion}

\[ \cos(xy)(y + x\frac{dy}{dx}) = 1 + \frac{dy}{dx}, \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dx}(x\cos(xy) - 1) = 1 - y\cos(xy), \]

\[ e^{x+y}(1 + \frac{dy}{dx}) = 2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx}, \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dx}(e^{x+y} - 2y) = 2x - e^{x+y}, \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2x - e^{x+y}}{e^{x+y} - 2y}. \]
\end{solution}

Differentiating \( \ln(x) + \ln(y) = 1 \):
\[ \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} = 0, \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{y}{x}. \]
To find \( \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \), differentiate \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) again:
\[ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = -\frac{x\frac{dy}{dx} - y}{x^2} = -\frac{-y^2/x - y}{x^2} = \frac{y(y + x)}{x^3}. \]

\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 5]
For \( 4x^2 + y^2 = 16 \):

\end{solution}

These exercises provide a diverse range of problems to practice implicit differentiation and help students understand its applications in different scenarios.

\section{Applications of Derivatives}
\subsection{Tangent Lines and Normal Lines}
\begin{application}
The equation of the tangent line to the curve \( y = f(x) \) at the point \( (a, f(a)) \) is given by \( y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a) \). The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency.
\end{application}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). Find the equation of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the point where \( x = 1 \).
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
First, we find the derivative of \( f(x) = x^2 \), which is \( f'(x) = 2x \). At \( x = 1 \), \( f'(1) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \). The equation of the tangent line at \( x = 1 \) is:
\[ y - 1 = 2(x - 1) \]
or
\[ y = 2x - 1. \]

To find the equation of the normal line, we use the fact that the slope of the normal line is the negative reciprocal of the tangent line's slope. Thus, the slope of the normal line is \( -\frac{1}{2} \), and its equation is:
\[ y - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 1) \]
or
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}. \]
\end{solution}

\end{discussion}

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Practice Problems on Tangent and Normal Lines}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 1]
The function is \( y = \sqrt{x} \). Its derivative is \( \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}} \). At \( x = 4 \), the slope of the tangent line is \( \frac{1}{2\sqrt{4}} = \frac{1}{4} \). The equation of the tangent line is given by \( y - f(a) = f'(a)(x - a) \), which simplifies to \( y - 2 = \frac{1}{4}(x - 4) \). The normal line is perpendicular to the tangent line, so its slope is the negative reciprocal, \( -4 \). The equation of the normal line is \( y - 2 = -4(x - 4) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 2]
For \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), \( f'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2} \). At \( x = 2 \), \( f'(2) = -\frac{1}{4} \), so the tangent line is \( y - \frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{4}(x - 2) \). The slope of the normal line is \( 4 \), so its equation is \( y - \frac{1}{2} = 4(x - 2) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 3]
The derivative of \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x + 1 \) is \( f'(x) = 9x^2 - 2 \). At \( x = -1 \), \( f'(-1) = 7 \). The equation of the tangent line is \( y - 2 = 7(x + 1) \). The normal line has a slope of \( -\frac{1}{7} \), so its equation is \( y - 2 = -\frac{1}{7}(x + 1) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 4]
For \( f(x) = \sin(x) \), \( f'(x) = \cos(x) \). At \( x = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( f'\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). The tangent line equation is \( y - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\left(x - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \). The normal line has a slope of \( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), with its equation being \( y - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\left(x - \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 5]
For \( y = \ln(x) \), \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x} \). At \( x = e \), the derivative is \( \frac{1}{e} \). The tangent line equation is \( y - 1 = \frac{1}{e}(x - e) \). The normal line's slope is \( -e \), so its equation is \( y - 1 = -e(x - e) \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 6]
For the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \), implicit differentiation gives \( 2x + 2yy' = 0 \). At \( (3, 4) \), \( y' = -\frac{3}{4} \). The equation of the tangent line is \( y - 4 = -\frac{3}{4}(x - 3) \). The normal line, with a slope of \( \frac{4}{3} \), has the equation \( y - 4 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 3) \).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Increasing and Decreasing Functions}
\begin{theorem}
A function \( f \) is increasing on an interval if, for any two numbers \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) in the interval with \( x_1 < x_2 \), we have \( f(x_1) \leq f(x_2) \). Similarly, \( f \) is decreasing on an interval if \( f(x_1) \geq f(x_2) \) for \( x_1 < x_2 \) in the interval. This can often be determined by analyzing the sign of its derivative \( f' \).
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2 \). To determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, we first find its derivative: \( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x \). Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \), we find critical points at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).

We then test intervals around these critical points to determine the sign of \( f'(x) \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \( x < 0 \), take \( x = -1 \): \( f'(-1) = -3 - 6 = -9 \) (negative, so \( f \) is decreasing).
    \item For \( 0 < x < 2 \), take \( x = 1 \): \( f'(1) = 3 - 6 = -3 \) (negative, so \( f \) is still decreasing).
    \item For \( x > 2 \), take \( x = 3 \): \( f'(3) = 27 - 18 = 9 \) (positive, so \( f \) is increasing).
\end{itemize}

Thus, \( f(x) \) is decreasing on \((- \infty, 2]\) and increasing on \([2, +\infty)\).
\end{example}

Students should first find the derivative of the function, determine critical points, and then analyze the sign of the derivative on intervals around these points to conclude where the function is increasing or decreasing.
\end{discussion}

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Practice Problems}

\begin{solution}[Problem 1]
To find where \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \) is increasing and decreasing, we first find its derivative:
\[ f'(x) = 2x - 4. \]
Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \), we find the critical point at \( x = 2 \). 

Examining the sign of \( f'(x) \) around this point:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \( x < 2 \), say \( x = 1 \), \( f'(1) = -2 \), so \( f(x) \) is decreasing.
    \item For \( x > 2 \), say \( x = 3 \), \( f'(3) = 2 \), so \( f(x) \) is increasing.
\end{itemize}
Thus, \( f(x) \) is decreasing on \((- \infty, 2)\) and increasing on \((2, \infty)\).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[Problem 2]
For \( g(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), the derivative is
\[ g'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2}. \]
Since \( g'(x) \) is always negative for \( x \neq 0 \), \( g(x) \) is always decreasing on its domain.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[Problem 3]
For \( h(x) = e^{-x} \), the derivative is
\[ h'(x) = -e^{-x}. \]
Since \( h'(x) < 0 \) for all \( x \), \( h(x) \) is always decreasing.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[Problem 4]
Consider \( p(x) = x^3 - 9x^2 + 24x - 15 \). The derivative is
\[ p'(x) = 3x^2 - 18x + 24. \]
Setting \( p'(x) = 0 \) yields \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 4 \) as critical points.

Checking intervals around these points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \( x < 2 \), \( p'(x) > 0 \), so \( p(x) \) is increasing.
    \item For \( 2 < x < 4 \), \( p'(x) < 0 \), so \( p(x) \) is decreasing.
    \item For \( x > 4 \), \( p'(x) > 0 \), so \( p(x) \) is increasing.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, \( p(x) \) is increasing on \((- \infty, 2) \cup (4, \infty)\) and decreasing on \((2, 4)\).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[Problem 5]
For \( q(x) = \sin(x) \) on \( [0, 2\pi] \), the derivative is
\[ q'(x) = \cos(x). \]
We find critical points where \( \cos(x) = 0 \), which are \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( x = \frac{3\pi}{2} \).

Examining the sign of \( q'(x) \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \( 0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2} \), \( q'(x) > 0 \), so \( q(x) \) is increasing.
    \item For \( \frac{\pi}{2} < x < \frac{3\pi}{2} \), \( q'(x) < 0 \), so \( q(x) \) is decreasing.
    \item For \( \frac{3\pi}{2} < x < 2\pi \), \( q'(x) > 0 \), so \( q(x) \) is increasing.
\end{itemize}
Thus, \( q(x) \) is increasing on \((0, \frac{\pi}{2}) \cup (\frac{3\pi}{2}, 2\pi)\) and decreasing on \((\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2})\).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Maxima and Minima}
\begin{method}
Critical points, where \( f'(x) = 0 \) or \( f'(x) \) does not exist, are potential locations of local maxima or minima. These points are found by solving the equation \( f'(x) = 0 \) or determining where \( f'(x) \) is undefined.
\end{method}

\begin{example}
Consider the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2 \). To find its critical points, we compute its derivative:
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x. \]
Setting \( f'(x) = 0 \), we find:
\[ 3x^2 - 6x = 0 \Rightarrow x(x - 2) = 0. \]
Therefore, the critical points are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 2 \).

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Practice Problems}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 1]
For the function \( h(x) = x^4 - 8x^2 + 16 \), we find the critical points by first computing the derivative:
\[ h'(x) = 4x^3 - 16x. \]
Setting \( h'(x) = 0 \) gives:
\[ 4x(x^2 - 4) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 0, \pm 2. \]
Using the second derivative test, we find:
\[ h''(x) = 12x^2 - 16. \]
At \( x = 0 \), \( h''(0) = -16 \) (negative), so \( x = 0 \) is a local maximum. At \( x = \pm 2 \), \( h''(\pm 2) = 16 \) (positive), so \( x = \pm 2 \) are local minima.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Problem 2]
The critical points of \( p(x) = 3x^3 - 12x + 9 \) are found by setting the derivative \( p'(x) = 9x^2 - 12 \) equal to zero:
\[ 9x^2 - 12 = 0 \Rightarrow x^2 = \frac{4}{3} \Rightarrow x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}. \]
Second derivative \( p''(x) = 18x \) at \( x = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} \) is positive, indicating a local minimum, and at \( x = -\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} \) is negative, indicating a local maximum.
\end{solution}

Setting \( q'(x) = 0 \) and factoring gives:
\[ x^2(5x^2 - 20x + 30) = 0. \]
The critical points are found by solving this equation. Use the first derivative test to determine whether these points are maxima or minima.

\subsection{Maxima and Minima - Again}

In calculus, finding the maximum and minimum values of a function is a fundamental task. Critical points are potential locations of local maxima or minima. These critical points occur where the derivative of the function either equals zero or does not exist.

To understand this concept visually, let's consider some examples.

\begin{example}
Consider the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. To find its critical points, we need to find where $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'(x)$ does not exist.

\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{comment}

% The graph of $f(x)$ is shown above. 

To find the critical points, we first find $f'(x)$:

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2
\]

Now, we set $f'(x) = 0$ to find the values of $x$ where the slope is zero:

\[
3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation, we find two critical points at $x = 1$ and $x = 2$. 

Next, we check if there are any critical points where $f'(x)$ does not exist. In this case, there are no such points.

Therefore, the critical points of the function $f(x)$ are $x = 1$ and $x = 2$, which are potential locations of local maxima or minima.

To determine whether these points correspond to maxima or minima, we can use the second derivative test or analyze the behavior of the function around these points.
\end{example}

In this example, we discuss how to find critical points using the derivative of a function. These critical points are essential for identifying potential local maxima or minima, which are crucial in optimization and real-world problem-solving.

\begin{solution}
In calculus, finding the maximum and minimum values of a function is a fundamental concept. Critical points play a crucial role in identifying these extrema. Critical points are points on the graph of a function where either the derivative is zero or the derivative does not exist.

\begin{example}
Consider the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1$. We want to find its critical points, which are potential locations of local maxima or minima.

First, let's calculate the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2
\]

Next, we set $f'(x)$ equal to zero to find where the slope of the function is zero:

\[
3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0
\]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, $a = 3$, $b = -6$, and $c = 2$. Applying the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 3}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{12 - 24}}{6} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{6} = \frac{6 \pm 2i\sqrt{3}}{6} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}i
\]

So, the critical points are $x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}i$ and $x = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}i$. However, these points are complex numbers, and we are typically interested in real-valued critical points. In this case, there are no real critical points where $f'(x)$ equals zero.

Now, let's consider whether there are any critical points where $f'(x)$ does not exist. In this example, the derivative $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2$ is a polynomial, which is defined for all real numbers. Therefore, there are no critical points where $f'(x)$ does not exist.

In conclusion, for the function $f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1$, there are no real critical points where $f'(x)$ equals zero or where $f'(x)$ does not exist. Thus, there are no potential local maxima or minima for this function among its critical points.
\end{example}
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Practical Engineering Example: Optimizing Beam Design}

In engineering, the concept of maxima and minima is crucial for optimizing various designs. Let's consider a practical example involving the design of a cantilever beam.

Suppose you are an engineer tasked with designing a cantilever beam that can support a maximum load while minimizing the material used. The beam's length is fixed at $L$ meters, and you can adjust its width $w$ and height $h$ in meters.

\begin{problem}
Determine the dimensions of the cantilever beam that will maximize its load-bearing capacity while minimizing the amount of material used.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To solve this problem, we need to establish a mathematical relationship between the load-bearing capacity and the amount of material used. 

Let's denote the load-bearing capacity as $P$ (in Newtons) and the amount of material used as $A$ (in square meters). We'll start by defining these quantities:

\[
P = k \cdot w \cdot h^2
\]

The load-bearing capacity, $P$, is directly proportional to the product of width, $w$, and the square of the height, $h$. Here, $k$ is a constant that depends on the material properties and other factors.

The amount of material used, $A$, is given by the surface area of the beam:

\[
A = 2 \cdot w \cdot h + L \cdot w
\]

We need to find the dimensions $(w, h)$ that maximize $P$ while minimizing $A$. This is an optimization problem. To solve it, we can use the method of critical points.

First, we'll find the critical points by setting the derivatives of $P$ and $A$ with respect to $w$ and $h$ equal to zero:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{dP}{dw} = k \cdot h^2 = 0 \\
\frac{dP}{dh} = 2k \cdot w \cdot h = 0 \\
\frac{dA}{dw} = 2h + L = 0 \\
\frac{dA}{dh} = 2w = 0
\end{cases}
\]

From the first two equations, we find that either $h = 0$ or $w = 0$ to maximize $P$. However, a beam with zero width or zero height is not practical. Therefore, we exclude these possibilities.

From the last two equations, we find that $w = -L/2$ and $h = 0$. However, these values are also impractical.

Thus, there are no critical points for this problem.

This result means that we need to consider the boundary conditions. Since $w$ and $h$ are positive values, we must choose values of $w$ and $h$ that satisfy the constraints $w > 0$, $h > 0$, and $A$ and $L$ are fixed constants.

Without loss of generality, let's set $L = 1$ meter (the length of the beam) and $A = 1$ square meter (to simplify the problem).

Given the constraints, we can use various numerical optimization techniques to find the dimensions $(w, h)$ that maximize $P$. This could involve using software tools like MATLAB or Python with libraries such as SciPy.

In engineering practice, optimizing designs often requires advanced numerical methods, and the specific approach may depend on the complexity of the problem and available tools. However, the concept of finding maxima and minima remains fundamental to such engineering optimizations.
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Practical Physics Example: Projectile Motion}

In physics, the concept of maxima and minima is often encountered when analyzing projectile motion. Let's consider a practical example involving the motion of a projectile.

Suppose you are a physics student tasked with studying the trajectory of a projectile launched from the ground at a certain angle $\theta$ with an initial velocity $v_0$. Your goal is to determine the launch angle $\theta$ that maximizes the range (horizontal distance) the projectile travels.

\begin{problem}
Find the launch angle $\theta$ that maximizes the range of a projectile launched with an initial velocity $v_0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the motion of the projectile and express the range as a function of the launch angle $\theta$. The range, denoted as $R$, is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$).

Our goal is to find the launch angle $\theta$ that maximizes $R$. This is an optimization problem, and we can use the method of critical points.

To find the critical points, we need to find where the derivative of $R$ with respect to $\theta$ equals zero:

\[
\frac{dR}{d\theta} = \frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}\right)
\]

Using the chain rule and simplifying:

\[
\frac{dR}{d\theta} = \frac{2v_0^2 \cos(2\theta)}{g}
\]

Setting this derivative equal to zero and solving for $\theta$:

\[
\frac{2v_0^2 \cos(2\theta)}{g} = 0
\]

Since $v_0^2$, $g$, and $\cos(2\theta)$ are all positive, there are no critical points where $\frac{dR}{d\theta}$ equals zero.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. The launch angle $\theta$ must be between $0$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (from $0$ to $90$ degrees).

To maximize $R$, we can perform numerical optimization by evaluating the expression for $R$ at various angles within this range and finding the angle that yields the maximum range.

In practice, engineers and physicists often use computational tools like Python or MATLAB to perform such optimizations. They may also consider air resistance and other factors for more realistic models. The specific approach may vary based on the problem's complexity.

In summary, to find the launch angle that maximizes the range of a projectile launched with initial velocity $v_0$, we analyze the range formula, find that there are no critical points, and use numerical optimization methods to find the optimal angle within the specified range.
\end{solution}


\subsubsection*{Practical Economics Example: Cost Minimization in Production}

In economics, the concept of maxima and minima plays a crucial role in cost minimization for production. Let's consider a practical example involving a manufacturing company that wants to minimize its production costs.

Suppose you are an economics student tasked with analyzing the cost structure of a manufacturing company. The company produces a certain quantity of a product, and its cost function is given by:

\[
C(q) = 200q^2 + 500q + 1000
\]

where $C(q)$ represents the total cost (in dollars) of producing $q$ units of the product.

Your goal is to determine the production quantity $q$ that minimizes the total cost.

\begin{problem}
Find the production quantity $q$ that minimizes the total cost for the manufacturing company.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To solve this problem, we need to find the production quantity $q$ that minimizes the total cost function $C(q)$. This is an optimization problem.

To find the critical points, we need to calculate the derivative of $C(q)$ with respect to $q$:

\[
\frac{dC}{dq} = \frac{d}{dq}(200q^2 + 500q + 1000) = 400q + 500
\]

Setting this derivative equal to zero and solving for $q$:

\[
400q + 500 = 0 \implies 400q = -500 \implies q = -\frac{500}{400} = -\frac{5}{4}
\]

However, a negative production quantity does not make sense in this context, so we discard this solution.

Therefore, there are no critical points where $\frac{dC}{dq}$ equals zero.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. The production quantity $q$ must be non-negative since it represents the quantity of a product produced.

To minimize the total cost, we can analyze the behavior of $C(q)$ as $q$ approaches the boundary conditions.

As $q$ approaches zero, $C(q)$ becomes $C(0) = 1000$. As $q$ becomes very large, $C(q)$ grows without bound.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, the manufacturing company should produce the quantity of the product that is as close to zero as possible. In practice, this means producing a minimal quantity or potentially not producing the product at all.

This example illustrates the application of maxima and minima concepts in economics, where a company aims to minimize production costs by analyzing the cost function and optimizing production quantity.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Concavity and Inflection Points}

In calculus, the concavity of a function plays a crucial role in understanding its behavior. A function can be concave up or concave down, and the second derivative \(f''(x)\) is the key to determining its concavity.

\begin{discussion}
A function is said to be \textbf{concave up} in an interval if its second derivative \(f''(x)\) is positive for all \(x\) in that interval. On the other hand, a function is \textbf{concave down} in an interval if its second derivative \(f''(x)\) is negative for all \(x\) in that interval.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = $x$,
    ylabel = $f(x)$,
    xmin = -3, xmax = 3,
    ymin = -2, ymax = 2,
    xtick = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2},
    ytick = {-1, 0, 1},
]
\addplot[domain=-2:2, samples=100, blue, thick] {x^2};
\node[label={45:{Concave Up}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:0,0) {};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\hspace{1cm}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = $x$,
    ylabel = $f(x)$,
    xmin = -3, xmax = 3,
    ymin = -2, ymax = 2,
    xtick = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2},
    ytick = {-1, 0, 1},
]
\addplot[domain=-2:2, samples=100, red, thick] {-x^2};
\node[label={45:{Concave Down}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:0,0) {};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Points where the concavity of a function changes are called \textbf{inflection points}. At an inflection point, the second derivative \(f''(x)\) changes sign from positive to negative or vice versa.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = $x$,
    ylabel = $f(x)$,
    xmin = -3, xmax = 3,
    ymin = -2, ymax = 2,
    xtick = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2},
    ytick = {-1, 0, 1},
]
\addplot[domain=-2:2, samples=100, green, thick] {x^3};
\node[label={45:{Inflection Point}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:0,0) {};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In the graph above, the function has an inflection point at \(x = 0\), where the concavity changes from concave up to concave down.

Inflection points are important in analyzing the behavior of functions, and they can provide insights into the behavior of real-world phenomena, such as the bending of materials or the changes in the economy.

To determine concavity and locate inflection points, it is essential to examine the sign changes of the second derivative \(f''(x)\) within the domain of interest.
\end{discussion}

\subsubsection*{Practice Problems}

Let's work through some example problems to help you solidify your understanding of concavity and inflection points.

\begin{problem}
Consider the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1\). Determine the intervals where the function is concave up, concave down, and find any inflection points.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To determine the intervals of concavity and locate inflection points, we need to find the second derivative \(f''(x)\) and analyze its sign changes.

First, calculate the first and second derivatives of \(f(x)\):

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x + 2 \quad \text{and} \quad f''(x) = 6x - 6
\]

Now, find the critical points of \(f''(x)\) by setting \(f''(x) = 0\):

\[
6x - 6 = 0 \implies x = 1
\]

So, \(x = 1\) is the only critical point of \(f''(x)\).

Next, analyze the sign changes of \(f''(x)\):

- For \(x < 1\), \(f''(x) < 0\), which means the function is concave down.
- For \(x > 1\), \(f''(x) > 0\), which means the function is concave up.

Thus, the function \(f(x)\) is concave down on the interval \((- \infty, 1)\) and concave up on the interval \((1, \infty)\).

To find inflection points, we need to check the concavity change at \(x = 1\). Since the concavity changes from down to up at \(x = 1\), there is an inflection point at \((1, f(1))\). Calculate \(f(1)\) to find the coordinates of the inflection point.

\[
f(1) = 1^3 - 3 \cdot 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1 - 3 + 2 + 1 = 1
\]

So, the inflection point is \((1, 1)\).

In summary, the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 1\) is concave down on \((- \infty, 1)\), concave up on \((1, \infty)\), and it has an inflection point at \((1, 1)\).
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
Consider the function \(g(x) = e^x + x^2 - 4\). Determine the intervals where the function is concave up, concave down, and find any inflection points.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To determine the intervals of concavity and locate inflection points for the function \(g(x)\), we need to find its second derivative \(g''(x)\) and analyze its sign changes.

First, calculate the first and second derivatives of \(g(x)\):

\[
g'(x) = e^x + 2x \quad \text{and} \quad g''(x) = e^x + 2
\]

Next, find the critical points of \(g''(x)\) by setting \(g''(x) = 0\):

\[
e^x + 2 = 0
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
e^x = -2 \quad \text{(no real solutions)}
\]

Since there are no real solutions for \(e^x = -2\), there are no critical points of \(g''(x)\).

Now, analyze the sign changes of \(g''(x)\):

- For all \(x\), \(g''(x) > 0\), which means the function is concave up everywhere.

Since \(g''(x)\) is always positive, there are no inflection points in the domain of \(g(x)\).

In summary, the function \(g(x) = e^x + x^2 - 4\) is concave up everywhere, and it does not have any inflection points.
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Engineering Application: Bridge Design}

In engineering, understanding the concavity and inflection points of a bridge's load-deflection curve is crucial for designing safe and efficient structures. Let's consider a practical example involving the design of a bridge.

Suppose you are an engineering student working on the design of a suspension bridge. The bridge's load-deflection curve is a critical factor in determining its structural integrity. You want to ensure that the bridge can withstand varying loads without experiencing excessive deflection.

\begin{problem}
Given the load-deflection curve of a suspension bridge, identify the regions of concavity and locate any inflection points. Determine the load range where the bridge behaves as expected.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To analyze the load-deflection curve, we need to examine its concavity and locate inflection points. The curve typically represents the relationship between the applied load (force) and the resulting deflection (displacement) of the bridge.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = Load (Force),
    ylabel = Deflection (Displacement),
    xmin = 0, xmax = 10000,
    ymin = 0, ymax = 500,
    xtick = {0, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 10000},
    ytick = {0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500},
]
\addplot[domain=0:10000, samples=100, blue, thick] {0.0002*x^2 - 2*x + 300};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The load-deflection curve shown above represents the behavior of the suspension bridge. To analyze its concavity, we need to find the second derivative of the curve with respect to load.

Let \(L\) be the load (Force) and \(D\) be the deflection (Displacement). We have:

\[
\frac{dD}{dL} = \frac{d}{dL}(0.0002L^2 - 2L + 300) = 0.0004L - 2
\]

Now, find the second derivative:

\[
\frac{d^2D}{dL^2} = \frac{d}{dL}(0.0004L - 2) = 0.0004
\]

The second derivative is a constant value, \(0.0004\), which means the bridge's load-deflection curve is concave up everywhere. There are no inflection points in this curve.

The load range where the bridge behaves as expected and is within the linear portion of the curve can be determined based on engineering specifications. In this example, it appears that the linear behavior extends from approximately \(L = 2000\) to \(L = 8000\) (Force).

In practice, engineers use such curves to ensure that the bridge remains within safe deflection limits for various loads.

In summary, understanding the concavity and inflection points of a bridge's load-deflection curve is essential for engineering design. In this example, we found that the curve is concave up throughout and does not have any inflection points. The bridge behaves as expected within the linear load range.
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Physics Application: Simple Harmonic Motion}

In physics, understanding the concavity and inflection points of a simple harmonic motion (SHM) graph is essential for analyzing oscillatory systems such as a mass-spring system. Let's consider a practical example involving SHM.

Suppose you are a physics student studying the motion of a mass attached to a spring. The position-time graph of the mass is crucial in understanding its behavior.

\begin{problem}
Given the position-time graph of a mass-spring system, identify the regions of concavity and locate any inflection points. Determine the time interval where the mass undergoes simple harmonic motion.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To analyze the position-time graph, we need to examine its concavity and locate inflection points. The graph typically represents the position (displacement) of the mass as a function of time.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = Time,
    ylabel = Position,
    xmin = 0, xmax = 10,
    ymin = -3, ymax = 3,
    xtick = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10},
    ytick = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3},
]
\addplot[domain=0:10, samples=100, blue, thick] {sin(deg(x))};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The position-time graph shown above represents the behavior of the mass-spring system. To analyze its concavity, we need to find the second derivative of the curve with respect to time.

Let \(t\) be time and \(x\) be position (displacement). We have:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(\sin(t)) = \cos(t)
\]

Now, find the second derivative:

\[
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}(\cos(t)) = -\sin(t)
\]

The second derivative is \(-\sin(t)\), which means the position-time graph changes concavity as it oscillates between concave up and concave down.

To locate inflection points, we need to find where the second derivative \(-\sin(t)\) equals zero:

\[
-\sin(t) = 0 \implies \sin(t) = 0
\]

Solving for \(t\):

\[
t = k\pi \quad \text{(where \(k\) is an integer)}
\]

So, the inflection points occur at \(t = k\pi\) for integer values of \(k\). At these points, the curve changes from concave up to concave down or vice versa.

The time interval where the mass undergoes simple harmonic motion is when the position-time graph is concave up. This occurs during the intervals between the inflection points, which are \((2\pi, 4\pi)\), \((4\pi, 6\pi)\), etc.

In summary, understanding the concavity and inflection points of a position-time graph is essential for analyzing simple harmonic motion in systems like a mass-spring system. In this example, we found that the graph changes concavity between concave up and concave down as it oscillates, and inflection points occur at \(t = k\pi\). The mass undergoes simple harmonic motion during the intervals between these inflection points.
\end{solution}

\subsubsection*{Economics Application: Cost and Revenue Analysis}

In economics, understanding the concavity and inflection points of cost and revenue functions is vital for optimizing production and pricing decisions. Let's consider a practical example involving a firm's cost and revenue analysis.

Suppose you are an economics student studying the cost and revenue functions of a manufacturing company. The company produces a certain quantity of a product and wants to determine the optimal production level to maximize its profit.

\begin{problem}
Given the cost and revenue functions, identify the regions of concavity for each function and locate any inflection points. Determine the production quantity that maximizes the company's profit.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To analyze the cost and revenue functions, we need to examine their concavity and locate inflection points. The cost and revenue functions typically represent the relationship between the quantity produced and the associated costs and revenue.

Let \(q\) be the quantity produced, \(C(q)\) be the total cost, and \(R(q)\) be the total revenue. We have:

\[
C(q) = 300q^2 - 1000q + 1000 \quad \text{and} \quad R(q) = 20q^2 + 800q
\]

To determine concavity, calculate the second derivatives of \(C(q)\) and \(R(q)\) with respect to \(q\):

\[
C''(q) = 600 \quad \text{and} \quad R''(q) = 40
\]

The second derivatives are constants, which means both cost and revenue functions are concave up everywhere.

To locate inflection points, we need to find where the second derivatives change sign, which does not occur since the second derivatives are constants. Therefore, there are no inflection points in these functions.

To maximize profit, we need to find the production quantity \(q\) that maximizes the profit function \(P(q) = R(q) - C(q)\). Calculate the profit function:

\[
P(q) = R(q) - C(q) = (20q^2 + 800q) - (300q^2 - 1000q + 1000) = -280q^2 + 1800q - 1000
\]

To maximize profit, find the critical points of \(P(q)\) by setting \(P'(q) = 0\):

\[
P'(q) = \frac{d}{dq}(-280q^2 + 1800q - 1000) = -560q + 1800 = 0
\]

Solving for \(q\):

\[
-560q + 1800 = 0 \implies -560q = -1800 \implies q = \frac{1800}{560} = \frac{9}{14}
\]

So, the production quantity that maximizes the company's profit is \(q = \frac{9}{14}\).

In summary, understanding the concavity and inflection points of cost and revenue functions is crucial for optimizing production and pricing decisions in economics. In this example, both functions are concave up, and there are no inflection points. The production quantity that maximizes profit is \(q = \frac{9}{14}\).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Optimization Problems}

Optimization problems are a fundamental part of mathematics and are widely applicable in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and more. These problems involve finding the maximum or minimum values of a function while considering certain constraints. The concepts of derivatives and critical points play a significant role in solving optimization problems.

\begin{application}
Optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum values of a function subject to certain constraints, often using derivatives.
\end{application}

\subsection{Unconstrained Optimization}

In unconstrained optimization, you aim to find the maximum or minimum value of a function without any constraints. Consider a real-valued function \(f(x)\) defined on a certain interval. To find the extreme values of \(f(x)\), you typically follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the critical points of \(f(x)\) by setting \(f'(x) = 0\).
  \item Use the second derivative test to determine whether each critical point corresponds to a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither.
  \item If necessary, check the endpoints of the interval to ensure you've found the global maximum or minimum.
\end{enumerate}

Let's illustrate this with an example:

\begin{problem}
Consider the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\) on the interval \([-1, 4]\). Find the values of \(x\) that maximize and minimize \(f(x)\) within this interval.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
To find the extreme values of \(f(x)\), we follow the steps outlined earlier.

1. Find the critical points by setting \(f'(x) = 0\):

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 3(x - 1)^2
\]

Setting \(3(x - 1)^2 = 0\), we find \(x = 1\) as the only critical point.

2. Use the second derivative test to determine the nature of the critical point:

\[
f''(x) = 6x - 12
\]

At \(x = 1\), \(f''(1) = 6 - 12 = -6\), which means it's a local maximum.

3. Check the endpoints of the interval:

\[
f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 9(-1) + 2 = -1 + 6 - 9 + 2 = -2
\]
\[
f(4) = 4^3 - 6(4)^2 + 9(4) + 2 = 64 - 96 + 36 + 2 = 6
\]

So, the maximum value of \(f(x)\) is 6 at \(x = 4\), and the minimum value is -2 at \(x = -1\).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = middle,
    xlabel = $x$,
    ylabel = $f(x)$,
    xmin = -2, xmax = 5,
    ymin = -5, ymax = 8,
    xtick = {-1, 1, 4},
    ytick = {-2, 6},
]
\addplot[domain=-2:5, samples=100, blue, thick] {x^3 - 6*x^2 + 9*x + 2};
\node[label={90:{Max}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:4,6) {};
\node[label={-90:{Min}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt] at (axis cs:-1,-2) {};
\draw[dotted] (axis cs:1,-5) -- (axis cs:1,8);
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

In this example, we found the maximum value of 6 at \(x = 4\) and the minimum value of -2 at \(x = -1\) within the interval \([-1, 4]\).
\end{solution}

\subsection{Constrained Optimization}

Constrained optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum values of a function while subject to certain constraints. These constraints are typically expressed as equations or inequalities. The method of Lagrange multipliers is often used to solve such problems.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

\begin{problem}
You have a rectangular piece of cardboard with a length of 10 inches and a width of 4 inches. You want to cut squares of equal size from each corner and fold the cardboard to create an open-top box. What should be the size of the squares to maximize the volume of the box?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
Let \(x\) be the side length of the squares cut from each corner. The volume \(V\) of the box is given by:

\[
V(x) = x(10 - 2x)(4 - 2x)
\]

To maximize \(V(x)\), we need to find the maximum of this function while considering the constraint \(0 \leq x \leq 2\) (since the squares cannot be larger than half the length or width of the cardboard).

First, find the critical points of \(V(x)\) by setting \(V'(x) = 0\):

\[
V'(x) = 10x^2 - 28x + 16
\]

Setting \(V'(x) = 0\) and solving for \(x\):

\[
10x^2 - 28x + 16 = 0 \quad \text{(quadratic equation)}
\]

Solving this equation yields two critical points: \(x = 1\) and \(x = \frac{8}{5}\). However, \(x = \frac{8}{5}\) is outside the constraint \(0 \leq x \leq 2\), so we consider only \(x = 1\) as a critical point.

To determine whether \(x = 1\) corresponds to a maximum, minimum, or neither, we use the second derivative test. Calculate \(V''(x)\):

\[
V''(x) = 20x - 28
\]

At \(x = 1\), \(V''(1) = 20 - 28 = -8\), which means it's a local maximum.

So, the size of the squares that maximizes the volume of the box is \(x = 1\) inch.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) rectangle (10,4);
\draw[fill=gray!30] (1,1) rectangle (9,3);
\draw[dashed] (1,1) -- (9,1) -- (9,3) -- (1,3) -- (1,1);
\node[anchor=east] at (0,2) {4};
\node[anchor=west] at (10,2) {4};
\node[anchor=north] at (5,0) {10};
\node[anchor=south] at (5,4) {10};
\node[anchor=south] at (5,1) {1};
\node[anchor=west] at (9,2) {x};
\node[anchor=south] at (5,3) {x};
\node[anchor=north] at (1,0) {x};
\node[anchor=east] at (1,2) {x};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Cutting 1-inch squares from each corner will maximize the volume of the open-top box.
\end{solution}

Optimization problems are an essential part of mathematical modeling and have broad applications in real-world scenarios. Whether unconstrained or subject to constraints, these problems often involve the use of derivatives and critical points to find optimal solutions.

\subsection{Related Rates}

Related rates problems are a category of calculus problems that involve finding the rate at which one quantity changes with respect to another. These problems typically require the application of the chain rule and involve multiple variables and rates of change.

\begin{method}
Related rates problems involve finding the rate at which one quantity changes with respect to another using the chain rule.
\end{method}

\subsection{Related Rates Basic Concepts}

In related rates problems, there are usually multiple variables involved, and the rates of change of these variables are related. To solve such problems, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify the variables involved and their relationships. Often, you'll have geometric shapes or situations involving similar triangles.
  \item Write down the given information, including the values of the variables and the rates at which they are changing.
  \item Determine the rate you need to find, usually by differentiating the equation that relates the variables.
  \item Apply the chain rule to express the rates of change in terms of the given values and the rate you want to find.
  \item Solve for the desired rate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Example Problem: Changing Triangle Dimensions}

Let's consider a simple example involving the change in dimensions of a right triangle:

\begin{problem}
A right triangle has a base of length \(3\) units and a height of length \(4\) units. If the base is increasing at a rate of \(2\) units per second and the height is decreasing at a rate of \(1\) unit per second, find the rate at which the hypotenuse is changing when the base is \(3\) units and the height is \(4\) units.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
We are given:

\begin{align*}
\text{Base } (b) &= 3 \text{ units} \quad \text{and} \\
\text{Height } (h) &= 4 \text{ units}
\end{align*}

We need to find:

\[
\frac{dh}{dt} \quad \text{(the rate of change of the hypotenuse)}
\]

We have the relationship between the variables:

\[
b^2 + h^2 = c^2
\]

Differentiating both sides with respect to time \(t\):

\[
2b\frac{db}{dt} + 2h\frac{dh}{dt} = 2c\frac{dc}{dt}
\]

Now, we plug in the given values and rates:

\[
2(3)(2) + 2(4)(-1) = 2c\frac{dc}{dt}
\]

Solving for \(\frac{dc}{dt}\), we get:

\[
\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{6 - 8}{2c} = \frac{-2}{2c} = \frac{-1}{c}
\]

Substituting \(b = 3\) and \(h = 4\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we find:

\[
c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 \implies c = 5 \text{ units}
\]

So, when the base is \(3\) units and the height is \(4\) units, the hypotenuse is \(5\) units. Now, we can find \(\frac{dc}{dt}\):

\[
\frac{dc}{dt} = \frac{-1}{5} \text{ units per second}
\]

Therefore, the rate at which the hypotenuse is changing when the base is \(3\) units and the height is \(4\) units is \(-\frac{1}{5}\) units per second.
\end{solution}

\subsubsection{Graphical Representation}

Let's visualize this problem with a right triangle:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) -- (3,0) -- (3,4) -- cycle;
\draw[dashed] (3,0) -- (3,4);
\node[anchor=east] at (0,0) {A};
\node[anchor=west] at (3,0) {B};
\node[anchor=south] at (3,4) {C};
\node[anchor=north] at (1.5,0) {3};
\node[anchor=west] at (3,2) {4};
\node[anchor=south] at (1.5,2) {5};
\draw[<->] (0,-0.5) -- (3,-0.5) node[midway,below] {$3$ units/sec};
\draw[<->] (3.5,0) -- (3.5,4) node[midway,right] {$4$ units/sec};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

As the base (\(AB\)) increases at \(3\) units per second and the height (\(BC\)) decreases at \(4\) units per second, the hypotenuse (\(AC\)) changes at a rate of \(-\frac{1}{5}\) units per second.

\end{center}

\subsection{Mean Value Theorem}
\begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem]
If a function \( f \) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\), then there exists at least one \(c\) in \((a, b)\) such that \(f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\).

These theorems are fundamental in calculus and provide critical insights into the behavior of differentiable functions. Rolle's Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem connect the properties of derivatives to the shape of a function's graph, while the Extreme Value Theorem guarantees the existence of global maximum and minimum values under certain conditions.

\subsubsection*{Exercises on Rolle's, Mean Value, and Extreme Value Theorems}

The following exercises will help you apply and understand the concepts of Rolle's Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, and Extreme Value Theorem.

\begin{exercise}
Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x \) on the interval \([0, 3]\), verify if Rolle's Theorem can be applied. If so, find the value of \( c \) in the interval where \( f'(c) = 0 \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Use the Mean Value Theorem to find a value \( c \) in the interval \([1, 4]\) such that the tangent line at \( c \) is parallel to the secant line joining the points \((1, f(1))\) and \((4, f(4))\) for the function \( f(x) = x^2 \).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Consider the function \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) on the interval \([0, \pi]\). Use the Extreme Value Theorem to discuss the existence of global maximum and minimum values of \( g(x) \) on this interval.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
For the function \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) on the interval \([1, 3]\), determine if the Mean Value Theorem applies. If it does, find the value of \( c \) that satisfies the theorem.
\end{exercise}

\subsubsection*{Solutions to Exercises on Rolle's, Mean Value, and Extreme Value Theorems}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 1]
First, we check if \( f(a) = f(b) \) for \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 3 \):
\[ f(0) = 0^3 - 6 \times 0^2 + 9 \times 0 = 0, \]
\[ f(3) = 3^3 - 6 \times 3^2 + 9 \times 3 = 0. \]
Since \( f(0) = f(3) \) and \( f(x) \) is continuous and differentiable on \([0, 3]\), Rolle's Theorem applies. 

To find \( c \), we solve \( f'(x) = 0 \):
\[ f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9, \]
\[ 0 = 3x^2 - 12x + 9. \]
Solving this quadratic equation gives the value of \( c \) in the interval \([0, 3]\).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 2]
For \( f(x) = x^2 \), the Mean Value Theorem states there exists a \( c \) in \([1, 4]\) such that:
\[ f'(c) = \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1}. \]
Since \( f'(x) = 2x \), we find \( c \) by solving:
\[ 2c = \frac{4^2 - 1^2}{4 - 1}. \]
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 3]
The function \( g(x) = \sin(x) \) is continuous on \([0, \pi]\). By the Extreme Value Theorem, it attains a maximum and minimum on this interval. The maximum is at \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} \) and the minimum at \( x = 0 \) or \( x = \pi \).
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[to Exercise 4]
Since \( h(x) = \frac{1}{x} \) is continuous and differentiable on \([1, 3]\), the Mean Value Theorem applies. To find \( c \), solve:
\[ h'(c) = \frac{h(3) - h(1)}{3 - 1}, \]
where \( h'(x) = -\frac{1}{x^2} \). Solving this will give the value of \( c \).
\end{solution}

These exercises and solutions provide practical applications of Rolle's Theorem, Mean Value Theorem, and Extreme Value Theorem, reinforcing their concepts through specific examples.

\chapter{Basic \LaTeX\ Guide}
\section*{A Quick Start to Your \LaTeX\ Journey}

Welcome to the immersive world of \LaTeX, a typesetting system widely used for creating scientific and professional documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographies. This guide is designed to offer you the foundational steps to grasp the basics of \LaTeX, enabling you to craft documents of high typographic quality akin to this book.

\subsection*{Setting Up Your \LaTeX\ Environment}

Before you can start creating documents with \LaTeX, you need to set up a working \LaTeX\ environment on your computer. Here's how you can do it:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download and install a \TeX\ distribution, which includes \LaTeX. For Windows, MiKTeX is a popular choice, while Mac users might prefer MacTeX, and TeX Live is widely used on Linux.
    \item Install a \LaTeX\ editor. Some popular options include TeXShop (for Mac), TeXworks (cross-platform), and Overleaf (an online \LaTeX\ editor).
    \item Ensure that your \TeX\ distribution and \LaTeX\ editor are properly configured and integrated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Creating Your First \LaTeX\ Document}

Once your \LaTeX\ environment is set up, you are ready to create your first \LaTeX\ document. Follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open your \LaTeX\ editor and create a new document.
    \item Insert the following code to set up a basic \LaTeX\ document:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, \LaTeX\ world!
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

    \item Save your document with a .tex file extension.
    \item Compile your document using your \LaTeX\ editor. This process converts your .tex file into a PDF document.
    \item View the output PDF and admire your first \LaTeX\ creation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Understanding \LaTeX\ Commands and Environments}

\LaTeX\ documents are created using a series of commands and environments. Commands typically start with a backslash \textbackslash\ and are used to format text, insert special characters, or execute functions. Environments are used to define specific sections of your document that require special formatting.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Commands:} For example, \textbackslash\textit\{italics\} will render the word "italics" in italic font.
    \item \textbf{Environments:} To create a bulleted list, you would use the \textit{itemize} environment:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
    \item First item
    \item Second item
\end{itemize}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Adding Structure to Your Document}

\LaTeX\ makes it easy to structure your documents with sections, subsections, and chapters. Here’s how you can add structure:

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction of your document.
\subsection{Background}
This subsection provides background information.
\subsubsection{Details}
This is a subsubsection for more detailed information.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Including Mathematical Formulas}

\LaTeX\ excels at typesetting mathematical formulas. Use the \textit{equation} environment or the \textdollar\ sign for inline formulas. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Adding Images and Tables}

You can also include images and tables in your \LaTeX\ documents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Images:} Use the \textit{graphicx} package and the \textit{includegraphics} command.
    \item \textbf{Tables:} Use the \textit{tabular} environment to create tables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Compiling Your Document}

\LaTeX\ documents need to be compiled to produce a PDF. This can be done through your \LaTeX\ editor. If your document includes bibliographies or cross-references, you may need to compile multiple times.

\subsection*{Conclusion: Embracing the Power of \LaTeX}
